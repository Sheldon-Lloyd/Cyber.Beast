Bursun and Makkusu/Yaharia charges at each other with Makkusu pointing

Makkusu: A war I didn’t even know existed until a few years ago

Flash back to were it all started

Makkusu Initally did not know that war was even being fought. Although he help to create and the tech to aid Cybervator in the war he thought it was being used to fight Cyber.Beast not in a War against other Cybervator

He learns of the war through Yaharia who does not know that Citizens don't know about the war. It is easy to keep it a secret since Cybervators and Citizens are segregated

Later Yaharia and Makkusu learn that the tech he created was not only used for the war but also used to forcefully control cybervator in order so that they wil fight in the war. They learn of this when they discover Bursun is fight against  his own will

The technolgy he regret

Makkusu finds and saves an injured Yaharia

Makkusu: What's your name

Yaharia: Yaharia Minia

Makkusu: do mind if I call you by your last name My Nina

Yaharia: you mean Minia

Makkusu: Nope I found you so your My Nia know

Yaharia: ha ha ha ok

Yaharia is angry that Makkusu has told about their metting despite the fact that the news mentioned neither of their names and that it was far from intentional as his friend spikes ancester got the info from him.

Later Yahria rescues Makkusu who is charged with tresson puting her own self in jeopardy he ask why she would do something like that and that should not have. She tells him ~~You forgot?~~ It's because I'm your Nia silly/remember
