# Cyber.Beast Bursun

## Brain Storm
Yahaira, Bursun and Makkusu all want to end the war however Bursun wants to maintain the status quo while Makkusu and Yahaira wants to free the Cybervators however unbeknownst to Makkusu Yahaira's Idea of freedom is killing the Majority of Citizens while enslaving the rest as she feels they have no place in the new world order. Spike wants to keep the world fragmented as it will allow him to maximize profits even if it means war. Makkusu wants to unify the world one generation at a time even if it means turning the world against him

Makkusu learns and reveals that Bursun and Yahaira are siblings

  - Bursun and Yahaira did not know that they were siblings at first despite the ability to read each other's minds

Makkusu created screen/goggles that green black & white cybervators use this was used so that Yahaira and Bursun would not be trick and so that he can see things through her eyes/perspective

  - Yahaira: wow I can see through your eyes. Yahaira/Makkusu: it's like you and I are one

  - Max upgraded it to read thoughts as well and eliminated the need for blood but only needs to resonate with the right frequency

  - It also is able tell exact qbits of of cybervators used in the future to establish Cybervator rankings
{

Yahaira: Makkusu!!! You think you can just trust in the children to make the better place. That’s why the world is where it is know, instead of placing that responsibility on future generation our generation take that responsibility only then will this circle of waiting for a better place end. You can’t raise children to live in a world that does not exist, it Is us that must lead that change. 

{

Yahaira: Isn't he your friend

Makkusu: Yeah but people that are materialistic will become money driven -- People that put money first will never put people first

}

Makkusu finds Yahaira's CSD while on a mission capturing a hub she calls to be teleported back down from her satellite as she got injured on her mission. Instead of destroying it or teleporting her back and arresting her he takes her CSD home then teleports her back to earth in his home. Her is where he heals her and names her My Nia reading her name off of his/her CSD

when Yahaira was younger she was taken from her family and was experimented on and forced to become a Cyber.Beast at one point she escaped and runs into a young Makkusu back when her name was Yahaira. Makkusu's parents tells him to stay away from her because she is a Cybervator despite him claim her as his own. His parent then calls the military police who sends her back to where she belongs.

Yahaira was rescued by the White and/or Blue Nation and allowed to live as long as she wore her limiter.



## Plot
Most Cybervators don’t know they are fighting a war for citizens as far as they know they are merely defending citizens from Cyber.Beast. Which is true considering the fact that it is another cybervators welding the Cyber.Beast they are fighting.

Citizens also don’t know about this war that is until a Scientist named Makkusu wants to more than just build tech to aid the Cybervators but wants to fight with them as well.

Many people speculated that a war may have being fought between the Red and Blue nation. Most thought it was at most limited to just Cyberspace


## Outline
The comic opens with Makkusu and Bursun fighting or preparing to fight each other

| Makkusu                                                                 | Bursun                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|

|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I don’t do it because I believe in war.                            |
| I do it because I believe it is the best way to stop/end this war. |                                                                  

Bursun and Makkusu/Yahaira charges at each other with Makkusu pointing

Makkusu: A war I didn’t even know existed until a few years ago

Flash back to were it all started

### Ordinary World
Yahaira is watching Cybervators on TV fighting and die while going against Cyber.Beast in Gladiator fashion

### Call to adventure
Yahaira discover how to remove her limiter allowing her to go into BurstDrive. After she desynergize she finds that military police is at her door to arrest her for doing so.

  - Yahaira: But no one was injured

  - They realize her talent in being able to tame a Cyber.Beast tell her that she can either serve her time in prison or  serve her time fighting for them
  
  - Yahaira: < you mean fighting you mean I get to use my BurstDrive to and all I have to do is fight Cyber.Beast >
  
    Yahaira: Sign me up
  
### Refusal of Call  
Yahaira is briefed for her first mission with Makkusu and learns that she is not just fighting Cybervators instead of Cyber.Beast realizing that she is fighting in a war no longer wants any part of it. She says that it is not what she signed up for.
  
  - Yaharia is told the gladiator like event is only a cover for the war. They explain some of the backstory for the reason behind the war
  
  - Yaharia is told that she has no other option. 

### Meeting the Mentor  
Makkusu informs her that she doesn't have to kill other Cybervators that she only needs to cut off their tails. He tells her why he is fighting in this war but is interupted by a squad mate and tells her not listen and warns Makkusu not to ram his preachy ideology down her throat

Makkusu Initially did not know that war was even being fought. Although he help to create and the tech to aid Cybervator in the war he thought it was being used to fight Cyber.Beast not in a War against other Cybervator

He learns of the war through Yahaira who does not know that Citizens don't know about the war. It is easy to keep it a secret since Cybervators and Citizens are segregated

Later Yahaira and Makkusu learn that the tech he created was not only used for the war but also used to forcefully control cybervator in order so that they will fight in the war. They learn of this when they discover Bursun is fight against  his own will

Makkusu finds and saves an injured Yahaira. Makkusu uses the tech he created to regrow Yahaira's limbs

Makkusu: What's your name

Yahaira: Yahaira Minia

Makkusu: do mind if I call you by your last name My Nina

Yahaira: you mean Minia

Makkusu: Nope I found you so your My Nia now

Yahaira: ha ha ha ok

Yahaira is angry that Makkusu has told about their meeting despite the fact that the news mentioned neither of their names and that it was far from intentional as his friend spikes ancestor got the info from him.

Makkusu joins the military Cybervator division if he hasn't already and starts training them to cut the tail of other Cybervators rather than to kill them. At one point he has to sub for another unit and is told by their handler not to teach them that pacifist crap. Maybe this is a unit in which Bursun is in. 

Makkusu starts going on missions during eclipses in an attempt to fixed the world and end the war. He does not kill but rather cuts the tails of cybervators. The media coins him with the name eclipse. A cybervator he spares at want point in the future will aid him defecting from their unit.

Later Yahaira rescues Makkusu who is charged with treason putting her own self in jeopardy he ask why she would do something like that and that she should not have. She tells him ~~You forgot?~~ It's because I'm your Nia silly

  - Spike is integrated about how he got the information and is eventually threaten of scene/script
      - he actually had no problems helping them in fact he wanted to strike a deal with them so that he could maximize his profits
  - Spike you've been found out they made me I had no choice sorry makkusu
  - Yahaira holds of the Cybervators while Makkusu escapes only to be captured


Makkusu asks Spike and Bursun to help save his sister Spike Understanding the meaning of family force Bursun to do it.

The final mission is to rescue Yahaira/Makkusu

They talk about how no one can or will take over the mainframe as no one understands the code and however goes down can't come back

While on the rescue mission they discover a way to expose the war by turning off the masking system allowing Cybervators to see the truth and threatening to show the world

Yahaira→Makkusu {
  Makkusu is about to go into the center of the moon of bottom of a hub

  You can't you'll kill yourself. As soon as you have children you no longer have the right to your own life it belongs to your children.

  Makkusu: What are you talking about, you're not making any since

  Yahaira: I'm pregnant 

  Makkusu: but I thought that was impossible 

}

Spike Bursun Yahaira and Makkusu all work together with spike serving as the handler in order end the war. This changes when Bursun and spike turn against Makkusu and Yahaira. 

After their last mission taking the last hub Bursun attack Yahaira and Makkusu and is being controlled by Spike. They sever the controls but Bursun still keeps fighting this is when it is learn that Bursun who was linked with Yahaira has learned that she plans to kill all the Citizens 
  - Spike takes control of the device and will use it to continue profiting of of the Cybervators
  - Yahaira wants to use the device to make the cybervators destroy all the citizen
  - You're on the wrong side Makkusu
  - No we're not the ones trying to keep the Cybervators enslaved
  - haha that's rich coming from someone that... Wait she didn't tell you Makkusu?! Yahaira plans to kill every Citizen on this planet leaving only the Cybervators

You don't understand I have no other choice do you really want your... no our child to live in a world like this a world in which they no free limited to be nothing but a slave. 


  
Makkusu tries to make them both stop fighting instead they fight with increasing intensity removing one limiter after another until they both Berserk with the help of spike manages to stop them but not before sacrifices himself in the process
  
  - Makkusu tells Spike if I don't make it just make sure the world know that Bursun and My Nia was the hero even if it means I have to be the villain. The world would never accept Cybervators otherwise. Spike ask him but what transparency. Makkusu replies I've learned that you can't have everything that their is a balance and a time and place for everything.

Before Makkusu dies he tells Yahaira You shouldn't treat Citizens race poorly or oppress them not for the sake of altruism but for the sake of the children's children as they never know when a grandchild may become apart of the citizens you hate so much. And if people in power create a world that hates citizens then your future grandchild may be the one that is hated is that what you really want

Spike tells Yahaira that word of this can never get out not if she wants to create the world she has always wanted. Yahaira agrees but tells him that if he ever crosses her. He says that he won't after he seen that power she has he realized that no one in this world could stop her and that he wants to be on the winning side. But this is when he sets everything in place for future generation will have the tools to retake their power.

They brand The Citizen Eclipse and the Cyvolters as the villains and Bursun and spike as the Hero that rescued Yahaira and exposed the truth to the world.

Although Bursun is Yahaira's brother their marriage was fabricated to prevent citizens from knowing that she had child with a citizen to maintain her pure image and to keep Makkusu role in the war hidden from history

Yahaira compromises with spike who proposes a competition in which Cybervator fight each other without killing each other this will allow Spike to monetize on them and will turn Cybervators into idols for the citizens and they be loved rather than hated. Cybervator will control the world wealth this will prevent the minority from being oppressed since they are the ones in power.

Since Cybervators were essentially weapons for Citizens which means they lost their power therefore no longer a threat
