# Cyber.Beast Bursun Outline

## Brain Storm
Yaharia, Bursun and Makkusu all want to end the war however Bursun wants to maintain the status quo while Makkusu and Yaharia wants to free the Cybervators however unbeknownst to Makkusu Yahria's Idea of freedom is killing the Majorty of Citizens whlie enslaving the rest as she feels they have no place in the new world order. Spike wants to keep the world fragmented as it will allow him to maximze profits even if it means war. Makkusu wants to unify the world one generation at a time even if it means turning the world against him

Makkusu learns and reveals that Bursun and Yaharia are siblings

  - Bursun and Yaharia did not know that they were siblings at first despite the ability to read each other's minds

Makkusu created screen/goggles that gb&w cybervators use this was used so that Yaharia and Bursun would not be trick and so that he can see things through her eyes/perspective

  - Yaharia: wow I can see through your eyes. Yaharia/Makkusu: it's like you and I are one

  - Max upgraded it to read thoughts as well and eliminated the need for blood but only needs to resonate with the right frequency

  - It also is able tell exact qbits of of cybervators used in the future to establish Cybervator rankings

Yaharia: Makkusu!!! You think you can just trust in the children to make the better place. That’s why the world is where it is know, instead of placing that responsibility on future generation our generation take that responsibility only then will this circle of waiting for a better place end. You can’t raise children to live in a world that does not exist, it Is us that must lead that change.

Yaharia: Isn't he your friend

Makkusu: Yeah but people that are materialistic will become money driven -- People that put money first will never put people first

|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| I don’t do it because I believe in war.                            |

Bursun and Makkusu/Yaharia charges at each other with Makkusu pointing

Makkusu: A war I didn’t even know existed until a few years ago

Flash back to were it all started

Makkusu Initally did not know that war was even being fought. Although he help to create and the tech to aid Cybervator in the war he thought it was being used to fight Cyber.Beast not in a War against other Cybervator

He learns of the war through Yaharia who does not know that Citizens don't know about the war. It is easy to keep it a secret since Cybervators and Citizens are segregated

Later Yaharia and Makkusu learn that the tech he created was not only used for the war but also used to forcefully control cybervator in order so that they wil fight in the war. They learn of this when they discover Bursun is fight against  his own will

The technolgy he regret

Makkusu finds and saves an injured Yaharia. Makkusu uses the tech he created to regrow yaharia's limbs

Makkusu: What's your name

Yaharia: Yaharia Minia

Makkusu: do mind if I call you by your last name My Nina

Yaharia: you mean Minia

Makkusu: Nope I found you so your My Nia know

Yaharia: ha ha ha ok

Yaharia is angry that Makkusu has told about their meeting despite the fact that the news mentioned neither of their names and that it was far from intentional as his friend spikes ancester got the info from him.

Makkusu joins the military Cybervator division if he hasnt already and starts training them to cut the tail of other Cybervators rather than to kill them. At one point he has to sub for another unit and is told by their handler not to teach them that pacifist crap. Maybe this is a unit in which Bursun is in. 

Makkusu starts going on missions during eclipses in an atempt to fixed the world and end the war. He does not kill but rather cuts the tails of cybervators. The media coins him with the name eclipse. A cybervator he spares at want point in the future will aid him defeacting from their unit.

Later Yahria rescues Makkusu who is charged with tresson puting her own self in jeopardy he ask why she would do something like that and that should not have. She tells him ~~You forgot?~~ It's because I'm your Nia silly/remember

  - Spike is intargated about how he got the informatioand is eventualy threaten of scene/script
      - he actually had no problems helping them infact he wanted to strike a deal with them so that he could maximize his profits
  - Spike you've been found out they made me I had no choice sorry makkusu
  - Yaharia holds of the Cybervators while Makkusu escapes only to be captured


Makkusu asks Spike and Bursun to help save his sister Spike Understanding the meaning of familly force Bursun to do it.

The final mission is to rescue Yaharia/Makkusu

While on the rescue mission they discover a way to expose the war by turning off the masking system allowing Cybervators to see the truth and threatening to show the world

Spike Bursun Yaharia and Makkusu all work together with spike serving as the handler in order end the war. This changes when Bursun and spike turn against Makkusu and Yaharia. 

After their last mission taking the last hub Bursun attack Yaharia and Makkusu and is being controlled by Spike. They sever the controls but Bursun still keeps fighting this is when it is learn that Bursun who was linked with Yaharia has learned that she plans to kill all the Citizens 
  - Spike takes control of the device and will use it to continue prfiting of of the Cybervators
  - Yaharia wants to use the device to make the cybervators destroy all the citizen
  - You're on the wrong side Makkusu
  - No we're not the ones trying to keep the Cybervators enslaved
  - haha thats rich coming from someone that... Wait she didn't tell you Makkusu?! Yaharia plans to kill every Citizen on this planet leaving only the Cybervators

You don't understand I have no other choice do you really want your... no our child to live in a world like this a world in which they no free limited to be nothing but a slave. 

Makkusu but I thought that was impossible 
  
upon learning that she is pregnant Makkusu tries to make them both stop fighting instead they fight with increasing intensity removing one limiter after another until they both Berserk with the help of spike manages to stop them but not before sacrifices himself in the process
  
  - Makkusu tells Spike if I don't make it just make sure the world know that Bursun and My Nia was the hero even if it means I have to be the villian. The world would never accept Cybervators otherwise. Spike ask him but what transparncy. Makkusu replies I've learned that you can't have everything that their is a balance and a time and place for everthing.

Before Makkusu dies he tells Yaharia You shouldn't treat Citizens race poorly or oppress them not for the sake of altruism but for the sake of the children's children as they never know when a grandchild may become apart of the citizens you hate so much. And if people in power create a world that hates citizens then your future grandchild may be the one that is hated is that what you really want

Spike tells Yaharia that word of this can never get out not if she wants to create the world she has always wanted. Yaharia agrees but tells him that if he ever crosses her. He says that he won't after he seen that power she has he realized that no one in this world could stop her and that he wants to be on the winning side. But this is when he sets everything in place for future generation will have the tools to retake their power.

They brand The Citizen Eclipse and the Cyvolters as the villians and Bursun and spike as the Hero that rescued Yaharia and exposed the truth to the world.

Although Bursun is Yaharia's brother their marriage was fabricated to prevent citizens from knowing that she had child with a citizen to maintain her pure image and to keep Makkusu role in the war hidden from history

Yaharia compromises with spike who proposes a competetion in which Cybervator fight eachother without killing eachother this will allow Spike to monitize on them and will turn Cybervators into idols for the citizens and they be loved rather than hated. Cybervator will control the world wealth this will prevent the minority from being oppressed since they are the ones in power.

Since Cybervators were essentially weapons for Citizens which means they lost their power therefore no longer a threat
