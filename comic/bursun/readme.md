Makkusu: A war I didn’t even know existed until a few years ago

Flash back to were it all started

Makkusu Initally did not know that war was even being fought. Although he help to create and the tech to aid Cybervator in the war he thought it was being used to fight Cyber.Beast not in a War against other Cybervator

He learns of the war through Yaharia who does not know that Citizens don't know about the war. It is easy to keep it a secret since Cybervators and Citizens are segregated

Later Yaharia and Makkusu learn that the tech he created was not only used for the war but also used to forcefully control cybervator in order so that they wil fight in the war. They learn of this when they discover Bursun is fight against  his own will

The technolgy he regret
