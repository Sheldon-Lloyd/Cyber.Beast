# Cyber.Beast Bursun

## Brain Storm
Yahaira, Bursun and Makkusu all want to end the war however Bursun wants to maintain the status quo while Makkusu and Yahaira wants to free the Cybervators however unbeknownst to Makkusu Yahaira's Idea of freedom is killing the Majority of Citizens while enslaving the rest as she feels they have no place in the new world order. Spike wants to keep the world fragmented as it will allow him to maximize profits even if it means war. Makkusu wants to unify the world one generation at a time even if it means turning the world against him

Makkusu learns and reveals that Bursun and Yahaira are siblings

  - Bursun and Yahaira did not know that they were siblings at first despite the ability to read each other's minds

Makkusu created screen/goggles that green black & white cybervators use this was used so that Yahaira and Bursun would not be trick and so that he can see things through her eyes/perspective

  - Yahaira: wow I can see through your eyes. Yahaira/Makkusu: it's like you and I are one

  - Max upgraded it to read thoughts as well and eliminated the need for blood but only needs to resonate with the right frequency

  - It also is able tell exact qbits of of cybervators used in the future to establish Cybervator rankings
{

Yahaira: Makkusu!!! You think you can just trust in the children to make the better place. That’s why the world is where it is know, instead of placing that responsibility on future generation our generation take that responsibility only then will this circle of waiting for a better place end. You can’t raise children to live in a world that does not exist, it Is us that must lead that change. 

{

Yahaira: Isn't he your friend

Makkusu: Yeah but people that are materialistic will become money driven -- People that put money first will never put people first

}

Makkusu finds Yahaira's CSD while on a mission capturing a hub she calls to be teleported back down from her satellite as she got injured on her mission. Instead of destroying it or teleporting her back and arresting her he takes her CSD home then teleports her back to earth in his home. Her is where he heals her and names her My Nia reading her name off of his/her CSD

Yahaira was rescued by the White and/or Blue Nation and allowed to live as long as she wore her limiter.

Makkusu uses a solar sail to get to the moon

Makkusu created the virus that eventualy becomes a feature of CSDs that allowed him to record and broadcast all Cybervators that comes in contact with the Virus. This becomes the beginings of the 2 way panopticon created within the future CNS as Makkusu virus not only effects Cybervators but his self as well. This is how he slowly exposes the war to world and at the same time gains more followers.

At first only cybervators of the Red Nation and those affiliated with them are exposed but this changes thanks to maybe spike who does not want to be left with a world controled by one nation as competion between the Blue and Red Nation is how he made his money. He then takes it upon his self to be the one that exposes the Blue Nation for manipulating and sometimes black mailing Cybervators.

## Plot
Most Cybervators don’t know they are fighting a war for citizens as far as they know they are merely defending citizens from Cyber.Beast. Which is true considering the fact that it is another cybervators weilding the Cyber.Beast they are fighting.

Citizens also don’t know about this war that is until a Scientist named Makkusu wants to more than just build tech to aid the Cybervators but wants to fight with them as well.

Many people speculated that a war may have being fought between the Red and Blue nation. Most thought it was at most limited to just Cyberspace


## Outline
The comic opens with Makkusu and Bursun fighting or preparing to fight each other it is a recording of events he left for future generations

Makkusu
My name is Yahaira.

I have been mentoring/training the next Generation of Cybervators to fight in this war. 

I don’t do it because I believe in war.

I do it because I believe it is the best way to stop/end this war.                                                               

Bursun and Makkusu/Yahaira charges at each other with Makkusu pointing

Makkusu: A war I didn’t even know existed until a few years ago

Flash back to were it all started

### Ordinary World
Makkusu is watching Cybervators on TV fighting and dying while going against Cyber.Beast in Gladiator fashion

### Call to adventure
Makkusu starts of as an inovator. he thinks that he is creating tech to help the world defeat cyberbeast and belive technnolgy alone will make the world a better place. He created much of the tech allowing cybervators to fight cyber.beast he learns that the world is not what he once thought when he creates tech he feels it will let citzens to fight as well eliminating the need to enslave Cybervators inorder to have the do the dirty work. 
  
### Refusal of Call  
Makkusu is briefed for his first mission with Yahaira and learns that he is not just fighting Cybervators instead of Cyber.Beast. Realizing that he is fighting in a war no longer wants any part of it. He says that it is not what she signed up for.
  
  -  Makkusu is told the gladiator like event is only a cover for the war. They explain some of the backstory for the reason behind the war
  
  
once he crosses the thresehold(telling yaharia that he is not supposed to be there) he learn that it is secret war that was being fought all along. He then sets out to create tech to end the war still beleving that it will fix everything(The world is broken and technolgy will be the catylst that will change it). Makkusu is told that Technology is what caused the war but he believes it is because the tech was made with the purpose of war and he will do the opposite(Makuusu technolgy started and technolgy will end it).This is until he learns even well intioned tech can be misused such as the tech he created that he learns was used by the red nation control cybervators. Makkusu goes on a mission in which he fights Bursun Yaharia recgonizes him and Makkusu is confused as to why he is attackinh her despite this fact. He then realize that Cybervtors are not kept enslaved due to the lack of technolgy but instead due to fact that they want to keep the war hidden(do you still think the war can be changed with technology alone)

### Meeting the Mentor  
tells yahaira that he is not supposed to be there and resposnds telling him that she knows he learns that it is secret war that was being fought all along. 

Makkusu informs her that she doesn't have to kill other Cybervators that she only needs to cut off their tails. He tells her why he is fighting in this war but is interupted by a squad mate and tells her not listen and warns Makkusu not to ram his preachy ideology down her throat

Makkusu tells her Initially did not know that war was even being fought. Although he help to create and the tech to aid Cybervator in the war he thought it was being used to fight Cyber.Beast not in a War against other Cybervator

It is easy to keep it a secret since Cybervators and Citizens are segregated

### Crossing the Threshold

He then sets out to create tech to end the war still beleving that it will fix everything(The world is broken and technolgy will be the catylst that will change it). This is until he learns even well intentioned tech can be misused such as the tech he created that he learns was used by the red nation control cybervators. 

### Test, Allies, Enemies

Makkusu goes on a mission in which he fights Bursun Yaharia recgonizes him and Makkusu is confused as to why he is attackinh her despite this fact. He then realize that Cybervtors are not kept enslaved due to the lack of technolgy but instead due to fact that they want to keep the war hidden(do you still think the war can be changed with technology alone)

Later Yahaira and Makkusu learn that the tech he created was not only used for the war but also used to forcefully control cybervator in order so that they will fight in the war. They learn of this when they discover Bursun is fight against  his own will

when Yahaira was younger she was taken from her family and was experimented on and forced to become a Cyber.Beast at one point she escaped and runs into a young Makkusu back when her name was Yahaira. Makkusu's parents tells him to stay away from her because she is a Cybervator despite him claim her as his own. His parent then calls the military police who sends her back to where she belongs.

- A 10 year old Makkusu finds and saves an 17 year old injured Yahaira. Makkusu uses the tech he created to regrow Yahaira's limbs

  Makkusu: What's your name

  Yahaira: Yahaira Minia

  Makkusu: do mind if I call you by your last name My Nina

  Yahaira: you mean Minia

  Makkusu: Nope I found you so your My Nia now

  Yahaira: ha ha ha ok

Yahaira is angry that Makkusu has told about their meeting despite the fact that the news mentioned neither of their names and that it was far from intentional as his spikes ancestor got the info from him.

Makkusu joins the military Cybervator division if he hasn't already and starts training them to cut the tail of other Cybervators rather than to kill them. At one point he has to sub for another unit and is told by their handler not to teach them that pacifist crap. Maybe this is a unit in which Bursun is in. 

Makkusu starts going on missions during eclipses in an attempt to fixed the world and end the war. He does not kill but rather cuts the tails of cybervators. The media coins him with the name eclipse. A cybervator he spares at want point in the future will aid him defecting from their unit.


### Approach
Learning that his tech is what aided

Later Yahaira rescues Makkusu who is charged with treason putting her own self in jeopardy he ask why she would do something like that and that she should not have. She tells him ~~You forgot?~~ It's because I'm your Nia silly

  - Spike is integrated about how he got the information and is eventually threaten of scene/script
      - he actually had no problems helping them in fact he wanted to strike a deal with them so that he could maximize his profits
  - Spike you've been found out they made me I had no choice sorry makkusu
  - Yahaira holds of the Cybervators while Makkusu escapes only to be captured


Makkusu asks Spike and Bursun to help save his sister Spike Understanding the meaning of family force Bursun to do it.

The final mission is to rescue Yahaira/Makkusu

They talk about how no one can or will take over the mainframe as no one understands the code and however goes down can't come back

While on the rescue mission they discover a way to expose the war by turning off the masking system allowing Cybervators to see the truth and threatening to show the world

Yahaira→Makkusu {
  Makkusu is about to go into the center of the moon of bottom of a hub

  You can't you'll kill yourself. 
  
  Is this your way for trying to make up for your past
  
  I'm doing this for the next generation of cybervators a generation that will be better off withou people like me
  
  Is that what this is about!
  
  My mother/father always told my mother/father(maybe from earlier flasback in which she remembers her parents on in which who tried to kill their self ass they could no longer tolertate the living conditions of of cybervator) As soon as you have children you no longer have the right to your own life it belongs to your children.

  Makkusu: What are you talking about, you're not making any since

  Yahaira: I'm pregnant 

  Makkusu: but I thought that was impossible 
  
  Bursun: I'll do it
  
  When bursun goes into the black hole by placing only his conisness in it instead. he see's a flash of the future in which aliens destroy their world

}

Spike Bursun Yahaira and Makkusu all work together with spike serving as the handler in order end the war. This changes when Bursun and spike turn against Makkusu and Yahaira. 

After their last mission taking the last hub Bursun attack Yahaira and Makkusu and is being controlled by Spike. They sever the controls but Bursun still keeps fighting this is when it is learn that Bursun who was linked with Yahaira has learned that she plans to kill all the Citizens 
  - Spike takes control of the device and will use it to continue profiting of of the Cybervators
  - Yahaira wants to use the device to make the cybervators destroy all the citizen
  - You're on the wrong side Makkusu
  - No we're not the ones trying to keep the Cybervators enslaved
  - haha that's rich coming from someone that... Wait she didn't tell you Makkusu?! Yahaira plans to kill every Citizen on this planet leaving only the Cybervators

You don't understand I have no other choice do you really want your... no our child to live in a world like this a world in which they no free limited to be nothing but a slave. You said it your self you wanted to make the world better for future generations.


  
Makkusu tries to make them both stop fighting instead they fight with increasing intensity removing one limiter after another until they both Berserk with the help of spike manages to stop them but not before sacrifices himself in the process
  
  - Makkusu tells Spike if I don't make it just make sure the world know that Bursun and My Nia was the hero even if it means I have to be the villain. The world would never accept Cybervators otherwise. Spike ask him but what transparency. Makkusu replies I've learned that you can't have everything that their is a balance and a time and place for everything.

Before Bursun dies he Bursun/Makkusu tells Yahaira You shouldn't treat Citizens race poorly or oppress them not for the sake of altruism but for the sake of the children's children as they never know when a grandchild may become apart of the citizens you hate so much. And if people in power create a world that hates citizens then your future grandchild may be the one that is hated is that what you really want

Spike tells Yahaira that word of this can never get out not if she wants to create the world she has always wanted. Yahaira agrees but tells him that if he ever crosses her. He says that he won't after he seen that power she has he realized that no one in this world could stop her and that he wants to be on the winning side. But this is when he sets everything in place for future generation will have the tools to retake their power.

They brand The Citizen Eclipse and the Cyvolters as the villains and Bursun and spike as the Hero that rescued Yahaira and exposed the truth to the world.

Although Bursun is Yahaira's brother their marriage was fabricated to prevent citizens from knowing that she had child with a citizen to maintain her pure image and to keep Makkusu role in the war hidden from history

Yahaira compromises with spike who proposes a competition in which Cybervator fight each other without killing each other this will allow Spike to monetize on them and will turn Cybervators into idols for the citizens and they be loved rather than hated. Cybervator will control the world wealth this will prevent the minority from being oppressed since they are the ones in power.

Citizens became completly dependent on Cybervators who were essentially weapons for Citizens which means they lost their power therefore no longer a threat.

NRA promised to provide protection for the citizens pariculary from Eclipse.

With the fall of the old world order. with the collapse, people need someone to lead them that leadership came in the form of hundreds of corporations. Because of the war BitGems had already become currency of the world which these companies all compete to capitalize on. Each company had their own method some even tried to hire Cybervator to illegaly steal Satellites containing BitGems. This was however thwarted by the CyOps of the NRA who made an example of these companies with severe punishment.

Companies took it upon their selves to provide aid for the citizens. However since the NRA no longer allowed regional based goverment companies would instead recruit people to be a member. This cause companies to threat and people to act as if each person essentially were individual colonies. If company no longer likes a member they can excommunicate them and a member can just as easily leave a company they no longer agreee with.

Only 2 companies survived this scramble to grab hold of the new world order ReNet and BluNet. This was thanks a non profit organization called the CNS which was supposed to be comprised of more than just BluNet an ReNet. Unfortunately only these two companies joined and prefered to be refered to as networks rather than companies. BluNet was the first to join as they had seen it as an opportunity to place Cybervators on a pedestal. The owner of ReNet on the other as usual for poeple of the Red Nation joined merely to compete against BluNet.

The CNS provided a UBI for citizens who had trouble obtaining GemBits. Cybervators had the opporunity to be admired. The CNS and Networks within it became the go to place for Citizens and Cybervator alike. Thee intense competion between ReNet and BluNet fueled it growth. Ultimately BluNet and ReNet survived through a combination of competing with each other in the CNS and buying the companies that did do to not joiing the CNS in it's infancy.

Initialy each citizen and Cybervator joined the network they were originally affliated with. This was until mixed teams those that consisted of Cybervators from all 5 races became the most successful. Once Cybervators relinquished their bias the Citizens did as well as they followed besst teams or their favorite Cybervator rather than blindly stick to one network.

The story ends with Max/Spike watching the history which was recorded by Spike using the tech Makkusu created
