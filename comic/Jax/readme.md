# Jax Outline
## Brain Storm
Jax wants to be a Cyber.Ops cybervator but knows that he must be a highly ranked Cybervator to do so.

He gathers a team of cybervators starting with Minia and his fiance Leona


# Act 1
It opens with Jax watching a video about busrsun the first Cybervator how he sacrificed hisselff to save the citizens put an end and how the war of the past created todays luxuries
Mina asks Jax if he would like to team up or Leona tells him that they are teaming up or he is the one that will ask the two of them Mina/Leona first who then invites her sister.

Their first Match is against Makkusu the lowest ranked Cybervator and they lose by a land slide

Jax and Mina does not make the championship team Leona however does. Even Makusu was ranked ahead of them and maybe even selected(although declining). Minia and Jax are both upset. 

Jax dicides that they will compete in the championships regadless he then takes Leona's Cyber.Beast and convices Minia to use it and the teleport into to space. Not being authorized the Satelites Cyber.Beast attack the two.
Minia and maybe Jax as well is tossed back to earth but in sepreate locations
# Act 2
Jax is rescued but Mina is lost because her CSD is broken or left in space
Minia wakes up finding her self in a strange house bandaged up. Mean while Jax is seen trying to explain himself to Kyshumu and Tomasina. He iss couaght in a lie and is told that he is always moniterd with his CSD. They use this to their advantage to find an aproxinate location of Minia from looking at the CSD's replay

His rivalry with Makkusu (and maybe Airiona) begins as he seemingly always gets the Cyber.Beast before him

Jakkusu and Minia Beat Makkusu but barely this is enough to get them ranked high enough to compete in the chamipionship
# Act 3
Jax Makes and wins the Championship but maybe Minia is the MVP
