Max: I customized Her name is Torrey


Max asks why Minia's her is red despite her being a green and blue type cybervator

Max: You are a blue and green cybervator but your hair is red how is that possible

Minia: oh this that well I was a born a green and blue type but when I got older they tried to edit my green genes(CRISPR) to be red mostly so that I could be a a red blue Xybrid and maybe even red green and blue. unfortunately it didn't work out and instead I just ended up with the red hair that would turn Green when ever I go into BurstDrive

Max: Why not make you red and blue from beginning

Minia: They tried that with harmony she became Insane from the emotional instability the red and green genes created they figured the added red genes on top of the green types ability to tame Cyber.Beast would prevent me from from being berserk I end up quite the opposite

Minia: I Know you probably think it's weird

Max: No I actually thought it was pretty cool.

Minia asks about his talking Cyber.Beast
