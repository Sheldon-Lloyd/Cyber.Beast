## Panel 1 
Tester: Sorry I'm not trying to be mean, it's just that you can't really become a cybervator without a tail.

Tester: in order to be eligible for a Cyber.Beast you need to show that you can synergize with it which is impossible without a tail.

Makkusu explains his controller to the receptionist 

Test: I understand there is no rule against who can be a cybervator but Since you don't have a tail I cant properly test your energy capacity so I'll have write your energy capacity as zero. We only are only taking the top 10(0) this year. We usually get 100(0) applicants every year so unless we get less than 10(0) applicants with and energy capacity greater or equal to yours the chance of you being accepted is basically zero.

Airiona is leaving out of a different door than what Makkusu came through and is still looking back listening to the conversation
