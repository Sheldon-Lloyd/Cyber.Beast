# Cyber.Beast(Makkusu) outline
## Theme
**The role sports play in society**
*subtheme: competition vs cooperation*

## Brainstorm
- Episodes: 22-27
- Roles
  - Broadcaster/Commentator: Spike, Makkusu?
  - Fan: Makkusu
  - Cybervator: Minia, Jax, Airiona, Xenos, Ace, Harmony
  - Chief: Kyshumu, Alex  

  - Minia learns that her mother is Torrey around the same time Makkusu tells her his mother is torrey or learns that his mother is torrey or vice versa
  
  - Speeding Bullet is discovered to be Airiona during the tournament a fight ensues between Airiona and Kyshumu. Airiona is defeated Kyshumu.

	Harmony is enraged by this and charges in to attack Kyshumu. Kyshumu thinks she is trying to help him and tells her to stand down that he has everything in control Avis realizes that she is not going after Airiona but rather Kyshumu he tells her to stop and jumps in front with his arms open. She barely moves her hand out of the way but it is not enough as the energy from the hand is enough to obliterate the left side of his head. She apologizes saying that she tried to stop or avoid him but could not. 
	
	This makes things worst as she goes berserk and Kyshumu and Xenos must work together Harmony to stop her.
 
- This is Xenos' last season before he announces his retirement
	
	- Xenos gives a retirement speech before declaring himself the leader of the Cyvolters (maybe save this for next season)
		
		Xenos: I want the future to be a world were there are no distinctions between citizen and cybervator one in which everyone is a cybervator in their on right.
			
		Xenos: Up to this point Cyvolters has not had a leader. Because of this they have done some things I am not proud. many if which goes against the vision/values of the Cyvolter. Without a leader the Cyvolters will become nothing more than an organization resembling a chicken without a head.
			
		It may be better if this show by using each person as an example rather than told {
		
		Xenos:
			
		Right now There are 4 types of Cyvolters
			
		The malicious type that just like finding people to take down the worst of them all.
			
		The type that doesn't want to look like the bad guy so they attack others to prove that they are not bad
			
		The one that has reformed and feels it is their duty to fix/save others. This type that does not want others to attack you so they prefer to warn you of repercussions
			
		Then there ones that follows(majority) the crowd doing what seems to be what's cool. This type is easily embarrassed and just wants others to fit in
		
		}
		if(they win) Xenos: even though we lost today I wont give up on helping the Cyvolters mission of creating a world with equal opportunity for all. We have technology but sometime society needs that final push
		
		Xenos: From this moment forward I will the lead the Cyvolters. Change can happen, has happened and, will happen.
	 
- In the second season years later the Cyvolters is now considered the Citizens league begin to do a type of initiation or point system in which Cybervators(not citizens) must attack "bad" cybervators in order to become a Cyvolter -- it is a rule created by Citizens.
	- The Cyvolters increase in sizes has become a detriment to their initial values
	- Since anyone can be a Cyvolter they are doing whatever they want and claim to be apart of the Cyvolters, because of this the Cyvolters realize they need a leader to lay a framework and places that duty upon Xenos.
	- Airiona is upset by the way the other cyvolter are acting she realizes that citizens can be just as bad as cybervator
	- This changes Airiona strengthens belief that the majority of of Cybervators are stupid instead all humans are. Xenos tells her that it actually mob mentality and selfish preservation that cause people to act this way. people don't want to be alone so they follow what they may think is the masses no matter how wrong it maybe to protect their self

- Makkusu's altruism becomes contagious and eventually becomes the basis for the Cyvolters identity at this point Makkusu either accepts or realize that he is a Cyvolter or she is shown helping another cyvolter

	- Max or someone that max helps someone or max saying its is solely for the purpose making him a stronger opponent strong enough to be a challenge for him in the future

	- Someone joins forces with Makkusu because they want the chance to fight someone even stronger than that protagonist in hopes of climbing up in ranking

- Makkusu finds old cyber.tech
		
	Makkusu realizes that even if he makes it into the tournament he won't be of much help since he can't go into a BurstDrive mode.
		
	He finds a hole in the ground left by Minia in it is old cyber.tech this is just what he needs to compete on even grounds (exposition opportunity):
		
	Earlier in the Cyber world history they used robots and somewhat bulky exosuits they even had space ships. this technology was lost after cybervators took over. Many would say that it halted their growth as Cybervator instead relied on cyber tech
		
	What he learns contradicts common knowledge as history has be rewritten
			
	- History is written by the losers as they write the history they are able to shape the perceived realty of their victors the future generation that sees this history will judge their current leaders based on the past villain like winners and the reasons the current system is place by this and will rise and over throw them or even an outside party may take them down based on this history much like the Mongols  (http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2016/11/history-is-written-by-losers.html)
		
- Minia helps Makkusu who is bullied
		Makkusu is watching a CNS broadcast while at the gym and is wearing headphones maybe visor headphones 
		
	Makkusu uses his UBI credit to become the sponsor of the cheapest cybervator he could find. Akia/Spike tells him he spent more money than he can make in a year as he buys majority of her stock shares in credit. He does not know how much money he has made as a cybervator an maybe doesn't even know he is a cybervator.

			
		
	Makkusu is getting bullied first they verbally abuse him. Akia tells haha look at Makkusu trying to get buff you think that just because you are getting in shape you will become a cybervator. lets see what you got. They then begin pushing him at this point the alert system on his CSD turns yellow or orange at which point the CSD says the threat level and ask Makkusu if he would like assistance he says no. one of the bullies Akia his it turned orange/yellow the leader then says don't worry the Cybervators will only come if it turns red or Makkusu asks for help which he says would never happen. 
		
	It appears like he might stand up for his self but he doesn't. Just as Makkusu is pushed or about to be pushed to the ground Minia appears the bullies run away. After they run away Makkusu ask what are you doing here and she's say I'm your Nia remember. Minia asks Makkusu if he is alright to which he replies that he is fine and that they are just bullies and tells her thanks but that he didn't need her help and that it never reached level red and she says she just happened to notice it rising and decided to intervene on her own “and besides I was bored anyway”

- Makkusu might not have enough points
- Someone he helped before allows him to compete
	
	The person either resigns or give him the fight that he needs to be ranked high enough to joins as they don't need them (thunora?)
		
- Makkusu is laughed at by a broadcaster maybe Akia for the fact that  he may have managed to become a highly ranked Cybervator but does not have an Tail let alone his missing arm and leg(s) so even if he makes it to the championship how does he expect to doing anything with out being able to go into burst drive mode.

- Alex becomes chief

### 8. Ordeal
Episodes: 16
- Makkusu is given/finds a new cyber.beast or the one he beats gives him his Cyber.Beast back as they know how much he helped others and wants to return the favor.

	The only problem is that he is almost out of time and no one would consider risking a match this late in the running. And he needs to face a top 3/5 cybervator to have any hope

	Jax however gives him that match after Minia pleads him citing him saving her. He agrees but tells her but dont expect me to let him win. She says she would never ask that of him.

	Jax and Makkusu fights which is watch by none/many as no one expect a match at this time.

	Makkusu fairs well but time is running out. At this point Jax forfeits knowing that he has a huge lead as the number one ranked cybervator.

	Jax: Don't get any ideas I'm just paying back the favor. 
		
	*Flash back of Jax shown hugging Minia after Makkusu saved her*

	Minia is surprised that he knew there was not much time left as he normal has a bad concept of time. He tells her Makkusu but he never said anything out loud

- Someone  asks if he is Upset that he was handed the spot rather than earning it on the team Makkusu tell Alex/Xenos/Minia/Jax/Akia/Airiona that it does matter that it is just a game. They reply telling him that is his problem/Thats why I can stand you/Its not just a game

	Makkusu is told that it is not just a game but that it the reason that we have no more wars and maintain peace among citizens as it gives people a place to belong satisfying the human desire for tribalism


- The NRA are against allowing citizens to participate in the CNS using unsanctioned Cyber.Beast distributed by the Cyvolters. They hold a meeting to discuss this with the CNS. The CNS tells them that is not their place to be decide rather someone should legally be allowed to compete.
	
- Not only does the CNS ignore their complaints officially recognize the Cyvolters allowing citizens to compete in the league. But because they don't have a hub the can't compete in the championships. Their reasoning is that the primary mission of the CNS is to distribute wealth among the citizens and this furthers that agenda. 
		
	All of the citizen who has become cybervators up until now to prevent this citizens will be allowed to join the CNS. this is done to prevent them from joining the cybervators just so that they can join the CNS.		
	
- Adding insult to injury the CNS request that both ReNet and BluNet gives up one hub to the Cyvolters so they can compete. This angers Kyshumu who yells that citizens shouldn't compete he threatens to pull ReNet out of the CNS
		
	He suggest that it is too dangerous and not having armor they are more likely to be killed and that they can't regrow limbs like a real cybervator


	
### 9. Reward (Seizing The Sword)
Episodes: 17
		
- Alex has been newly elected as the Chief of BluNet
	
- Alex tells the NRA that both Citizens and Cybervators has taken a liking to Makkusu and that their no telling how they might respond if they don't let him compete.

- Alex allows Makkusu to compete with BluNet or offers up Kassiea/Xenos' hub allowing Makkusu to compete	

- Minia is traded to BluNet by Leona which is all over the news. 
	- Minia would've been starting over Leona had she not been traded.
	- Kyshumu is enraged as this is right before the hub she is traded to becomes a Cyvolter hub. He then realizes this is the perfect opportunity to ensure Makkusu loses -- he tells her to throw the match. This leaves Minia conflicted because she does not want to see Makkusu fail.
	
- Makkusu uses his tech to compete in the CNS championships
	
	Airiona: Wow I thought what you made before was incredible how did you create this stuff
		
	Makkusu: I didn't make it. Its I made from tech that I found under my house(the hole Minia/Airiona created). A lot of it was unfinished All I did was make a few modifications
		
	Makkusu: I call it an Elimiter. Normally a cyber.beast would be able to synergize with a cybervator thanks to thier tail. Since everybody including cybervators evolved from plants I used a plant to act as the cyber.beast[1](https://www.engadget.com/2018/12/05/mit-researchers-create-a-robot-houseplant-that-moves-on-its-own/),[2]( https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563688/robot-plant-hybrid-hexa-vincross-succulent ). 
		
	:so you are basically sending commands to a berserk cyber.beast like a green/black cybervator. So it basically makes you like a Xybrid. 
		other.person: what how.
		
	Max: < Well you see I can also hyperlink with other cybervator see what they are thinking and send commands as well. >
		
	other.person: you just hyperlinked to me with out a fist bump. 
		
	Max: no I did, during the fight(getting blood) / I did it using the right vibration frequency
		
	Airiona: This must be the(tech lost to time) lost technology from thousands of years ago Xenos was telling. Haha who Cybervators really are a ~~cancer~~(find new word) to the world
	
- Makkusu's team is formed
	
	| Position | First   | Second       | Third | Fourth |

	| Red      | Harmony | Aarock       |       |        |
	| Green    | Airiona | Makkusu      |       |        |

	|----------|---------|--------------|-------|--------|
	| Red      | Jax     |              |       |        |
	| Green    | Leona   | Tomasina     |       |        |
	| Blue     | Leona?  |              |       |        |
	| Black    | Jax     |              |       |        |
	| White    | Thunora |              |       |        |
		
- Harmony attacks Makkusu who tries to introduce his self a nearly kills him but she stops which surprises Ace

When Airiona and Minia take off their cloaks leaving their one piece backless outfit their scar can be compared by the reader

Airiona has had multiple wounds to her body most gained through her training to become a Cybervator fighting until all of her energy has been depleted in order to climb the ranks as quickly as possible, unlike the pristine MiNia who had everything handed to her who will quit at the halfway mark of her energy level. 

After seeing both seeing the backs of both Airiona and Minia Makkusu looks confused Xenos sees him looking maybe makes a quip then proceeds to explain the reason that Aironia has so many scars compared to Everyone else and why Minia has none

Airiona's flashback shows parents yell at the kids encouraging to beat up the other kids “Get him, come on!"

- Championship commentary	

	**Panel 1:**
	This years class of cybervators displayed their breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief. This is the moment when cybervators gets the opportunity to fulfill their hopes and their family dreams. 
	
	**Panel 2:**
	And as they prepare to take this stage they will follow in the the footsteps of so many cybervators, 
	
	**Panel 3:**
	some of which stepped into greatness(Kyshumu) the moment they became cybervators 
	
	**Panel 4:**
	others grew into their greatness(Xenos). 

- Xenos gets injured and gets a limb or two cut off and Avis is missing
	- During the match it appears that Minia is doing just what her father wanted(throwing the match) as she performs poorly during her match. It turns out that this is not the case. She has been trying her best but does she not want to hurt her opponent hampering her abilities.
	- Airiona tells Makkusu that Minia is sabotaging them. Makkusu(he was voted team captain despite not starting) then suggests that Minia be removed from her Blue position. Airiona is happy thinking Minia is being bench--however Makkusu bench's Airiona instead who is visibly upset. Someone asks then who will take the Blue/White position (Harmony(can't)/Xenos(injured)/Avis (missing)). 
	
		Makkusu: well then I guess Air...
		
		Xenos: You should Makkusu. It will be the perfect chance to show everyone what you're capable of.
		
		Airiona: are you crazy he doesn't have a BurstDrive he'll get his self killed
		
		Makkusu: Actually! He might be a genius. You see Jax is a lot like Minia and the last person on that team that would kill anyone. There is no telling how much he will hold back against a Citizen like me. But what I do know is that his biggest weakness will become our strength.
		
	- After Makkusu is substituted in
	
		Tomasina:We have huge lead there is now way they will make a comeback. So don’t go all out although he thinks he’s a Cybervator he’s still a citizen

		Jax: ya ya ya I know one wrong move and I could kill him. Don’t worry I got this.

		
	 - They begin to make/orchestrate a historic comeback but their efforts fall short as the deficit Minia creating was to great to overcome
