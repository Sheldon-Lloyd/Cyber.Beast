  - Handlers/Cornerman/crew: Makkusu?
  - Fan: Makkusu
  - Cybervator: Minia, Jax, Airiona, Xenos, Ace, Harmony
  - Chief: Kyshumu, Alex  
 
 - Makkusu is laughed at by a broadcaster maybe Akia for the fact that sure he may have managed to become a highly ranked Cybervator but does not have an Tail let alone his missing arm and leg(s) so how does he expect to doing anything with out being able to go into burst drive mode.
 
- This is Xenos' last season before he anounces his retirement
	
	- Xenos gives a retirement speech before declaring himself the leader of the Cyvolters (maybe save this for next season)
		
		Xenos: I want the future to be a world were there are no distincions between citzen and cybervator one in which everyone is a cybervator in their on right.
			
		Xenos: Up to this point Cyvolters has not had a leader. Because of this they have done some things I am not proud. many if which goes against the vision/values of the Cyvolter. Without a leader the Cyvolters will become nothing more than an organization resembling a chicken without a head.
			
		It may be better if this show by using each person as an example rather than told {
		
		Xenos:
			
		Right now There are 4 types of cyvolters
			
		The malicious type that just like finding people to take down the worst of them all.
			
		The type that doesn't want to look like the bad guy so they attack others to prove that they are not bad
			
		The one that has reformed and feels it is their duty to fix/save others. This type that does not want others to attack you so they prefer to warn you of repercussions
			
		Then there ones that follows(majority) the crowd doing what seems to be what's cool. This type is easily embarrassed and just wants others to fit in
		
		}
		if(they win) Xenos: even though we lost today I wont give up on helping the Cyvolters mission of creating a world with equal opportunity for all. We have technolgy but sometime socity needs that final push
		
		Xenos: From this moment forward I will the lead the Cyvolters. Change can happen, has happened and, will happen.
	 
- In the second season years later the cyvolters is now considered the Citizens league begin to do a type of initiation or point system in which Cybervators(not citizens) must attack "bad" cybervators inorder to become a Cyvolter -- it is a rule created by Citizens.
	- The cyvolters increase in sizes has become a detriment to their initial values
	- Since anyone can be a Cyvolter they are doing whatever they want and claim to be apart of the Cyvolters, because of this the Cyvolters realize they need a leader to lay a framework and places that duty upon Xenos.
	- Airiona is upset by the way the other cyvolter are acting she realizes that citizens can be just as bad as cybervator
	- This changes Airiona strengthens belief that the majority of of Cybervators are stupid instead all humans are. Xenos tells her that it actually mob mentality and selfish preservation that cause people to act this way. people don't want to be alone so they follow what they may think is the masses no matter how wrong it maybe to protect their self

- Makkusu's alturism becomes contagious and eventually becomes the basis for the Cyvolters identity at this point Makkusu either accepts or realize that he is a Cyvolter or she is shown helping another cyvolter

	- Max or someone that max helps someone or max saying its is solely for the purpose making him a stronger opponent strong enough to be a challenge for him in the future

	- Someone joins forces with Makusu because they want the chance to fight someone even stronger than that protagonist in hopes of climbing up in ranking	
	
	- Makkusu is about to mine cyber.beast or fight another cybervator alone He spots a girl that waves at him but he doesn't know who she is so he he casually ignores her
	
		Later he gets into some trouble and is saved by her. As she pick him  up and carries him out of harm's way

		Girl: She says hi again

		Makkusu: wait aren't you(showing image of her waving)

		Girl: Yep I knew you were a cyvolter the moment I saw you. It would be a disgrace if I didn't -- my cyber.beast is a bear/shark after all. Us cyvolter have to stick together ya know

		Makkusu: wait so you know who each AND EVERY cyvolter is

		Girl: Don’t woorry I won't tell

		He finds a hole in the ground left by Minia in it is old cyber.tech this is just what he needs to compete on even grounds (exposition opportunity):
		
		Earlier in the Cyber world history they used robots and somewhat bulky exosuits they even had space ships. this technology was lost after cybervators took over. Many would say that it halted their growth as Cybervator instead relied on cyber tech
		
		What he learns contradicts common knowledge as history has be rewritten
			
		- History is written by the losers as they write the history they are able to shape the perceived realty of their victors the future generation that sees this history will judge their current leaders based on the past villain like winners and the reasons the current system is place by this and will rise and over throw them or even an outside party may take them down based on this history much like the Mongols  (http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2016/11/history-is-written-by-losers.html)

		Makkusu is getting bullied first they verbally abuse him. Akia tells haha look at Makkusu trying to get buff you think that just because you are geting in shape you will become a cybervator. lets see what you got. They then begin pushing him at this point the alert system on his CSD turns yellow or orange at which point the CSD says the threat level and ask Makkusu if he would like assistance he says no. one of the bullies Akia his it turned orange/yellow the leader then says don't worry the Cybervators will only come if it turns red or Makkusu asks for help which he says would never happen. 
		
		It appears like he might stand up for his self but he doesn't. Just as Makkusu is pushed or about to be pushed to the ground Minia appears the bullies run away. After they run away Makkusu ask what are you doing here and shes say i'm your Nia remember. Minia asks Makkusu if he is alright to which he replies that he is fine and that they are just bullies and tells her thanks but that he didn't need her help and that it never reached level red and she says she just happened to notice it rising and decided to intervene on her own “and besides I was bored anyway”

Their reasoning is that the primary mission of the CNS is to distribute wealth amoung the citzens and this furthers that agenda.

		Makkusu: I call it an Elimter. Normally a cyber.beast would be able to synergize with a cybervator thanks to thier tail.

Someone asks then who will take the Blue/White position (Harmony(can't)/Xenos(injured)/Avis (missing)).
