## Panel 1 
Tester: Sorry I'm not trying to be mean, it's just that you can't really become a cybervator without a tail.

Tester: in order to be eligible for a Cyber.Beast you need to show that you can synergize with it which is impossible without a tail.

Max explains his controller to the receptionist 

Test: I understand there is no rule against who can be a cybervator but Since you don't have a tail I cant properly test your energy capacity so I'll have write your energy capacity as zero. We are only taking the top 10(0) this year. We usually get 100(0) applicants every year so unless we get less than 10(0) applicants with and energy capacity greater or equal to yours the chance of you being accepted is basically zero.

Tester: look at her she has a tail and still has not been accept


## Last Panel
Airiona seen is leaving out of a different door than what Max came through and is still looking back listening to the conversation

Tester: If all goes well we will pair you with your first Cyber.Beast.

Do you know how long it will take 

Test It depends on how many applications we get
