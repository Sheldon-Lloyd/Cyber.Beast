## Plot
Max is a huge fan of the relativly new Cybervator leauge. His view of the league changes however after Mina a cybervator literally falls into his lap(Look down at his leg Max thinks back my prostetic leg and her fall wasn't the only thing that broke that day). He learns the sport he loves so much is but a microcosim of reality. '

## Notes/Brainstorm

Cyber.beast(faint voice): Help me...

Minia: did you hear that

Jax: hear what

Minia(head turned back): I thought I just heard--

Jax: Stay focused

Minia is knocked off the satellite

Jax: Minia!

CyTek takes advantage of ReNet's secrecy of the war using it against it's people through the cyvolters. They do this by revealing the war and showing them that they have been killing humans rather than cyber.beast. How the sport they love have been rigided to hide it. They delibratly choose thoose cybervators that already disagrees with ReNet or Kyshumu primarly on their treatment of humans.
They are lied to and told that have been sabatoging them making their geneticly modefied Cybervators berserk turning them into cyber.beast. To apear more honest they reveal a fault of CyTek as well but presenting it a way that makes it seem like a lesser evil. They are told about the cybervator experminations but that what ReNet has been doing is far worse as they are killing inoccent cybervators in a way that gives them no choice in the matter. Cybervators that are prison geunie pigs that should be freed rather than killed. It's determined to be a problem dealt with after ReNet has be fixed as they can not fight a 2 front war and is the best way to spare as many lives as posible
 
Xenos orginally recruited by CyTek to become a cyvolter instead tries to coup the ccyvolters for his own agenda which is why CyTek finds a way to kill him. They do the same with Max but fails multiple times the first time trying to us Kyshumu to kill him like Xenos but Max wins instead and then sending a team of cybervators again failing as tomasina and Minia both protects him in their own way


The secret of the war and the cybervators are hidden by giving rookies false information and those who leak the information is fired and because everyone has a differnt variation of the truth they become less beilliveable

Minia does not intially thought that Xenos took down Leona and is the reason she does not hate eclipse. eventully eclipse intenionally kills someone from ReNet but she does not think eclipse did it. He even helps her and Jax kill a "cyber.beast" or a cybervator. After Max promised to stop killing an eclipse impostor kills someone. At this point she is sure that Eclipse did not kill any one given that she was right there with eclipse or Max when the person was killed.

Minia gives Max his first cyber.beast the cyvolters gives him his second cyber.beast. This leads Max to think that Minia is also a cyvolter. He comes to this realization during his interview with spike who questions rather he knew he was aiding the cyvolters. with his back against the wall he starts to suspect Minia and Spike uses the opportunity to put words in his mouth when he accedntly tells spike that Minia had crashed in his house and had given him a cyber.beast.
Spike: some people are acusing you and many more are praising you for helping the cyvolters. Did you realize you have been aiding the cyvolters?

Max: I didn't create the the software to upgrade CSDs. At the time I had no idea the softwar it was based on was created by the cyvolters. I just wanted to give my self and other humans to be cybervators. Was I being selfish? Maybe. But one thing I do know is that I wanted reform not revolution.

Spike: Certainly you should have known the cyber.beast you have been using cam from the Cyvolters. It was right their on the invition sent with the cyber.beast.

Max: well acctualy i thought i got it from minia. when I helped her when she crashed outside of my house I assumed she gave it to me when she took... my CSD and made herself my cybervator

Spike: so you're saying that Minia set you up

Max: No no no of course not I--

Spike: You knew about it the so you that Minia was a cybervator. Would that not be considered aiding them

Max: No no no

spike: but do you think that Minia is a Cyvolter

Max: I... I don't know. I'm I told you more than I should have. I have to go.

When Max hangs up spike acuses Minia of being a cyvolter and suggest that is the reason that Minia wanted him to stay quiet

After the interview Minia is enraged that Max told telporting to max while he is in the shower

Minia: I... I trusted you!

Max goes to save Minia using a glider he created. First teleports to the satellite Minia connected him to then using a cyberbeast to fly to the moon

When saving Minia Max gets into trouble but is saved by Kassiea(a.k.a Airiona) who catches Max and Xenos who fends off Kyshumu

On his way to rescuing Minia or earlier in the day on a train he sees Kassiea who waves but he doesn't know who she is so he he casually ignores her

Kassia: Hi again

Max: Wait arent you <does she know who I am?>

Kassiea smiles


While on a mission Eclipse is saved by Minia as she caries him he questions rather she knows who he is. The situation takes a turn and Max must save Minia after she steps in front of an attack sacrifing herself. After taking her to his hideout she informs him that she knows who he is while he tries to hide from jax

It is confirmed that shes knows who Max is on that Kassiea know who he is when max returns the favor saving Kassiea who passes out while on a mission testing her new energy bean. Or takes a turn as Kassiea must sacrfice herself steping in front of an attack to save Max. He takes her to his hide out until they have the opporutinty to return to her base of operations. At this time Jax or Mina goes searching for Max as they want to make sure he is safe since he is not next to his CSD and Eclipse and Airiona was seen in the area

Kassiea: Yep I knew you were a cyvolter the moment I saw you. 

[A flashback to when Max saw her on the train]

Kassiea: It would be a disgrace if I didn't -- my cyber.beast is a bear/shark after all. Us cyvolter have to stick together ya know

Max: wait so you know who each AND EVERY cyvolter is

Kassiea: Donâ€™t woorry I won't tell.

After Mina and Jax leaves 

Kassiea: My real name is Kassiea by the way

Kassiea: What? It wouldnt be fair if I knew who you were but you didn't at least know my name

She sees the memorbilla of Xenos around his house.

Kassiea: So your a fan of Xenos I see

Max(puts head down): you mean was a big fan

She goes on to tell Max that she know about the people he killed and that he should stop if not for his self then at least for Xenos. She tails him the cyvolters could use a hand

Besides cuting the tail of Leona after Xenos tells him to Max killed his first victim by accident as he droped the person he was intergating his second was intentional set up by a false lead from his first victim. His third was inderctly by helping Minia and Jax. The forth his was framed after promising he wouold stop killing and last was Kyshumu

After saving Minia Kassiea will step in to lead the cyvolters seeing the need for leadership. She will do what she felt she should have did along time ago rather than hiding. She defects and turns her hub/satellite/subnet into the base of opperations for the cyvolters. She tells her team to leave or stay as they defend Minia. To Kassiea's surprise Minia still rejects the offer to join the Cyvolters choosing instead to change the system from within. She is cleared of wrong using the evince found from Max's CSD. To Kassiea and Mina's surprise Xenos does not presure Mina to join instead he reveals hisself to be everything absolving Minia of her crimes. When Minia asks why he did he tells her that people don't want true justice no matter what you did people would never forgive unless they have a sutible replacement.

The cyvolters reveal that the world is at war and has never been fighting cyber.beast but rather other cybervators. Prisoners enslaved by BluNet

The world has always hated ReNet because of kyshumu and propaganda created by BluNet. Eventually hates BluNet/CyTek after learning about the treatment of prisoners. Prisoners that are forced to fight with the promise of freedom and those that do not comply are turned into cyber.beast controlled and forced to fight regardless 

The cybervator leauge is shut down something kyshumu wanted to do anyway to prevent Max from becoming a cybervator. Making rules like banning humans siting cyber.beast givin by the cyvolters and even cheating in the cyberspace league

In regards to not wanting to allow the citizens to participate{

Minia/Airiona: what are you afraid of?

Kyshumu: everything

Recgonizing Minia's loyalty Kyshumu then goes to shows Minia that this sport is a proxy war. He reveals some things that the cyvolters have already told her as well as some things that contradicts what she was told. Maybe mouments latter the Cyvolters reveal this and more to the entire world
}

When Minia returnrs they clear her of her crimes but return must serve in the newly establised joint millitary of BluNet and ReNet tasked with taking down the cyvolters

Max no longer wants to kill Kyshumu he instead wants to sever the bind he learns Bursun has on Kyshumu
