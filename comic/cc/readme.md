## Themes
Sloth when the world seems corupt and apears to be falling apart around the answer is not to check out  but rather to dig deaper. Accept that fact that you your life might get harder you may even make the world worst in the short run

Freedom(chaos) vs order(manipulation){To much trust in freedom and order can have a negative impact on society. Societies with to much freedom will look for order usally from a sinlge entity. Socities with to much order will look for freedom. technolgyy amplies both freedom and order.  Dictators can expoloite both the free and the ordered with technology. Fooling those looking for order under the guise of safety. Tricking those looking for freedom through disire

Cyvolters: When the world is in chaos we bring order where there is subjectgation we give freedom

}

Spirtual heart vs logical mind(cyber.beast vs cybervators)

Emotion vs logic(cyber.beast are logic driven and humans have emotion or both are able to control each because of the lack or excess of both){Max's cyber.beast however has emotion and Max has less emotion than normal}

## Plot
Max is a huge fan of the relativly new Cybervator leauge. His view of the league changes however after Mina a cybervator literally falls into his lap(Look down at his leg Max thinks back my prostetic leg and her fall wasn't the only thing that broke that day). He learns the sport he loves so much is but a microcosim of reality.

BluNet as the only true network left as a result of th on going conflict between ReNet and BluNet as BluNet had eventualy stoped being mercinaries instead taking satellites for their self breaking the promise and removing the purpose of Renet taking advatange of their power. The back and fourth of taking satellites eventually lead to the collapse of ever network except BluNet

Given that ReNet is centralized and back by the last nation on earth destablizing them is as simple as destabilizing that nation. Making it's people hate it's nation. This was why the cyvolters was created witin ReNet and Kyshumu was turned into the leader. Those on earth begins to affiliate ReNet with the cyvolters. The ReNet citzens begin to hate Kyshumu as well as ReNets

BluNet has continued spread the rumor that ReNet has threaten to withdraw protection from the threat of cyber.beast. In reality cyber.beast at this point had not appeared in years.

They also expose the flaws within ReNets foundational sport. Humans prevented from competing(max a citzen of earth and all human being banned even thoose that are citzens of ReNet). The riging of the sport ensuring that those that lose a satellite within the war also lose a satellite within the sport even though satellites have noting to do with the sport(Minia making it to the final despite having only one fan and not being allowed to compete as she is accused of being a cyvolter. With the threat of cyvolters becoming real on earth people on earth lose trust in the Cyvolters leading to man revoking cybervators as body guards). ReNet had allowed BluNet to compete in order to mask the secret war between the 2 networks.

## Character Development
People think that Xenos and Kyshumu sepreated over a petty dispute over the like of kassiea. This turns out to be a false assumption as the real reason is a difference in their means to achive albeit similar ideals as Xenos bealived the best way to save the Cybervators is to cut off thier tails at the expense of their memories. Kyshumu on other hand prefers to do it the old fashioned way with brute force killing all who oposes him

## Reminders
Max kills his father when he is being taken away

## Notes/Brainstorm
In the past cyber.coordinators would drop satellites onto hubs enabling them to take over multple satellites at once

(0): We can do a hub drop attack

Kassiea: Sure it my be a surprise attack but that's insanly dificult thats why networks rarely do it anymore

(0): Then will do it at during the next eclipse

Kassiea: Now you are asking the impossible. In case your forget no one has energy at without the sun.

(0): we might not but Eclipse does

When Minia is first arrested she tells the other cybervators 

"I'm Mina with the ReNet Griffins. I'm Mina daughter of Kyshumu. I'm worth millions!"

Max aka eclipse is marked for execution. Dispite being the original eclipse. The same eclipse that created the CSD software. The Max that showed everyone anyone could be a cybervator/cyber.fighter.

Created Kassiea CSDs were intially used as a means to control the first Cybervators of which were red. A way to monitor them in case they go berserk so that another cybervator can easily teleport to their location to kill them. This was because at one point Cybervators were considered dangerous and was isolated on moons away from socity. Here they learn to control their abilites and develop a culture of their own. They were only allowed to return to socitey as long as they agree to be monitored.

When Makkusu comes to the cyber.suniverse he creates an algorithim that can surpress a cyber.beast even allowing them to be placed in plants rather than who he calls humans

Makkusu and Kassia made the orginal versionn but was unable to find a way place and/or control a cyber.beast within it. Max solved the problem Kassia however did not CyTek's impaintence leads them to instead use it to control cybervators someting Kassia had orginal only did to demostrate the potential of the device. In the alternate version CyTek/Kassiea/Makkusu is instead freaked out and hides the technology afraid of potential misuse.

Makkusu was not killed by max rather it was his CSD that was deestroyed and eaten and was used to vist the cyber.suniverse. He worked with Kassiea to create it. They first test it on a cyber.beast. She sees it as an opportunity to use it in place of cybervators if she can find a way to control it. she first tests it on cybervators maybe Xenos volenteers himself as a guenia pig. It works by taking in the DNA of a human or animal placing it into a seed. Any one from that dimension that shares that DNA structure of that species can then use that CSD seed to come into that world. Any one not just the orginal DNA donor will be able to use that seed to come into the world rather dead or alive. If they are alive it is done by achiving alpha wave state. It came happen accindently while dreaming or or intentionally while meditaing. This is how many of the cyber.beast end up in the world contections to random dead or dreaming animals. With humans such a phenomenon is unlikely due to their prefrontal cortex. For Makkusu maybe time in his world moves at a slower rate than the the cyber.suniverse. Makkusu coined the term cyber.suniverse and call the people cyvers

Kassiea is a geneticist by trade which is why she has trouble programing the CSD

Max improved the CSD software that had been opensourced in an act of rebelion by Kassiea. Soon after the cyvolters send out cyber.beast to everyone Max thinks he is choosen to be a cybervator at first later rereading is acceptance letter realizing that he has been serving the cyvolters. He then and demostrated the weaponized version posting a video online. He suggests that everyone will be able to become cybervators.

Max causes Minia to get arrested and becomes eclipse inorder to free her

Tomasina: Eclipse has approiated the name of the Cyvolters twisted the symbol and what it stands for. Using it for a means to his own ends but we will not stand for this. Thanks to the help of Akia and Jax he has been brought to justice. Unfourtanly he was able to take one more causlty before we defeated him. But Max will will forever be remembered as the catylst that sparked the change when the world need it most. He showed us That humans are just as valuble as cybervators. The statue of Max is revealed

Bursun tells the team that they must kill Max before the world learns that he is eclpise

At this point the world has come to admire Max but they fear the cyvoltor who they beleave to be affiliated with Eclipse who the fear even more.

 the symbol that has been the revolutions catylast

Minia confronts Max before or during the mission to Kill eclipse.

They were like a family to me

Max explains everything. Jax/Tomasina Tells Minia not trust him that trust him is how they got in this mess

Minia realizes the that it was an accident and tries to convince Max to escape.

Minia: So your eclipse. Of all people who wouldve guessed

MiNia: this whole time it was you. Why!?

Max ignores her

Akia: So I heard you killed Kyshumu

Max continues to ignore her

Minia: Was it worth it.

Max: what did you say

Minia: Killing kyshumu was it worth it.

Max: You think I wanted to kill him.

Minia: but you--

Max: No it wasn't

Akia: huh?

Max: You wanted know if it was worth

Max: Kyshumu didn't kill my father. I did.

Akia: What are you talking about

Max: Kyshumu. Kyshumu was my father!

Max flash back leading to Kyshumu's death including going berserk

Max: I never wanted to kill him. Even before I knew. Maybe if I knew. maybe.

Max: He was trying to protect me

Akia: So you didnt kill him. Then that means-- 

Scene of Jax Satellite drop on to Max's hideout

Minia: Max you have to get out of here. Jax and Tomasina is on there way to kill you. <Maybe if I tell them truth. No there is no way they will listen theyre filled with rage>

Max I don't deserve to live


He does nott move forcing Minia to defend Max. she final fights with all she has showing her true power fight 3 against 1.

Jax: Movie aside Mina. I don't want to hurt you

Minia: And I don't want you to hurt Max

Jax: (don't worry about it) I'm not gonna hurt him...

Minia comes out her fighting stance

Jax(slams hands together to synergize): I'm gonna kill him

Max ask her why she is doing this that he does not desevere her help 

Minia: Did you forget

She stops some of Akia's attacks along with Jax.

Minia: "I'm your Nia"


Tomasina realizes how strong Minia is and that they will go nowhere targeting Max. 

Tomasina: Change of plans Akia we can't win like this. We'll have to take out Minia first.

Akia sees this as an opportunity to get payback from when Minia intialy defended Max for the first time

She then attacks Minia to Jax's dismay Max finaly steps in to save Minia.

Tomasina and Akia work together delivering the final blow and Max Evaporates

Minia is placed back in prison for aiding Max

Tomasina tries to tell Max that that Makkusu has to go home but Max insits that he goes with him knowing that he wont see him again for months Makkusu tries to playcat him telling some other time but fails causing Max to go berserk turning into a cyber.beast even though one was never implanted as makkusu did not neither Max or Jax to have a cyber.beast fear they will die in the process even though he may risk them going berserk in the future he instead wants them to be able to make thier own decision when they are older.

Tomasina tells Kyshumu that she is through with him and that the arranged marige is off and that he will never see Jax again

Tomasina: Lets go Jax

Jax pulls away that same way a toddler would pull away from a stranger clinging to Kyshumu

Jax: No! I stay with chief

Tomasina: What did you say to him

Kyshumu: What he need to hear the same thing the world need to hear

	 Nothing he got the news from the same place everyone else did

He is refreing to the news that annouced the Cyber.beast appear killing an entire family and how it could it have been worse had  a prototype human cytek geneticly engineered to be a cybervator Tomasina not been there and how a ReNet cyber.beast was no were in sight until it was too late. The rumor are true ReNet has abandoned us. Thankfuly there was only 2 human casulities Makkusu, and his son was. The rest were cybervaotrs. This however is a lie Jax is the only surviving member but Kyshumu did not want the world that Makkusu had a child with Tomasina. Instead he waits until later to reveal Jax as he adopted after his parents who they press assume to be cybervators was killed in the incindent. In reality The footage shows Tomasina geting everyone to saftey but does not show Kyshumu defeating the Cyber.Beast causing Max to lose his memory and Kyshumu to hide it.

Tomasina: so you you didnt tell him

Kyshumu: should I

	 should he know

Kyshumu tells Torrey that Max's mother wants nothing to do with him since he is not a cybervator like she is. Max knowing this resents his mother for abandoning him.

When he learns that tomasina is his mother he confronts her only to be rejected.
- After Leona lies to Max about Kyshumu killing him and his father Torrey reveals some of the truth. She tells him that his father never abandoned him but was killed and that it was his mother that abandoned him. She tells him that that is all she can tell him leaving Max confused seting on his path for revenge
- Tomasina: My son? ha don't make me laugh. You're not my son. I've learned accept that fact that Jax is more than enough along time ago. And if you were my son you would be a cybervator but you your a human how could you possiblyy think that you of all people could be my son. Having Jax as my only son is more than enough for me.

Cyber.beast(faint voice): Help me...

Minia: did you hear that

Jax: hear what

Minia(head turned back): I thought I just heard--

Jax: Stay focused

Minia is knocked off the satellite

Jax: Minia!

CyTek takes advantage of ReNet's secrecy of the war using it against it's people through the cyvolters. They do this by revealing the war and showing them that they have been killing humans rather than cyber.beast. How the sport they love have been rigided to hide it. They delibratly choose thoose cybervators that already disagrees with ReNet or Kyshumu primarly on their treatment of humans.
They are lied to and told that have been sabatoging them making their geneticly modefied Cybervators berserk turning them into cyber.beast. To apear more honest they reveal a fault of CyTek as well but presenting it a way that makes it seem like a lesser evil. They are told about the cybervator experminations but that what ReNet has been doing is far worse as they are killing inoccent cybervators in a way that gives them no choice in the matter. Cybervators that are prison geunie pigs that should be freed rather than killed. It's determined to be a problem dealt with after ReNet has be fixed as they can not fight a 2 front war and is the best way to spare as many lives as posible
 
Xenos orginally recruited by CyTek to become a cyvolter instead tries to coup the ccyvolters for his own agenda which is why CyTek finds a way to kill him. They do the same with Max but fails multiple times the first time trying to us Kyshumu to kill him like Xenos but Max wins instead and then sending a team of cybervators again failing as tomasina and Minia both protects him in their own way


The secret of the war and the cybervators are hidden by giving rookies false information and those who leak the information is fired and because everyone has a differnt variation of the truth they become less beilliveable

Minia does not intially thought that Xenos took down Leona and is the reason she does not hate eclipse. eventully eclipse intenionally kills someone from ReNet but she does not think eclipse did it. He even helps her and Jax kill a "cyber.beast" or a cybervator. After Max promised to stop killing an eclipse impostor kills someone. At this point she is sure that Eclipse did not kill any one given that she was right there with eclipse or Max when the person was killed.

Minia gives Max his first cyber.beast the cyvolters gives him his second cyber.beast. This leads Max to think that Minia is also a cyvolter. He comes to this realization during his interview with spike who questions rather he knew he was aiding the cyvolters. with his back against the wall he starts to suspect Minia and Spike uses the opportunity to put words in his mouth when he accedntly tells spike that Minia had crashed in his house and had given him a cyber.beast.
Spike: some people are acusing you and many more are praising you for helping the cyvolters. Did you realize you have been aiding the cyvolters?

Max: I didn't create the the software to upgrade CSDs. At the time I had no idea the softwar it was based on was created by the cyvolters. I just wanted to give my self and other humans to be cybervators. Was I being selfish? Maybe. But one thing I do know is that I wanted reform not revolution.

Spike: Certainly you should have known the cyber.beast you have been using cam from the Cyvolters. It was right their on the invition sent with the cyber.beast.

Max: well acctualy i thought i got it from minia. when I helped her when she crashed outside of my house I assumed she gave it to me when she took... my CSD and made herself my cybervator

Spike: so you're saying that Minia set you up

Max: No no no of course not I--

Spike: You knew about it the so you that Minia was a cybervator. Would that not be considered aiding them

Max: No no no

spike: but do you think that Minia is a Cyvolter

Max: I... I don't know. I'm I told you more than I should have. I have to go.

When Max hangs up spike acuses Minia of being a cyvolter and suggest that is the reason that Minia wanted him to stay quiet

After the interview Minia is enraged that Max told telporting to max while he is in the shower

Minia: I... I trusted you!

Max goes to save Minia using a glider he created. First teleports to the satellite Minia connected him to then using a cyberbeast to fly to the moon

When saving Minia Max gets into trouble but is saved by Kassiea(a.k.a Airiona) who catches Max and Xenos who fends off Kyshumu

On his way to rescuing Minia or earlier in the day on a train he sees Kassiea who waves but he doesn't know who she is so he he casually ignores her

Kassia: Hi again

Max: Wait arent you <does she know who I am?>

Kassiea smiles

While on a mission Eclipse is saved by Minia as she caries him he questions rather she knows who he is. The situation takes a turn and Max must save Minia after she steps in front of an attack sacrifing herself. After taking her to his hideout she informs him that she knows who he is while he tries to hide from jax

It is confirmed that shes knows who Max is on that Kassiea know who he is when max returns the favor saving Kassiea who passes out while on a mission testing her new energy bean. Or takes a turn as Kassiea must sacrfice herself steping in front of an attack to save Max. He takes her to his hide out until they have the opporutinty to return to her base of operations. At this time Jax or Mina goes searching for Max as they want to make sure he is safe since he is not next to his CSD and Eclipse and Airiona was seen in the area

Kassiea: Yep I knew you were a cyvolter the moment I saw you. 

[A flashback to when Max saw her on the train]

Kassiea: It would be a disgrace if I didn't -- my cyber.beast is a bear/shark after all. Us cyvolter have to stick together ya know

Max: wait so you know who each AND EVERY cyvolter is

Kassiea: Don’t woorry I won't tell.

After Mina and Jax leaves 

Kassiea: My real name is Kassiea by the way

Kassiea: What? It wouldnt be fair if I knew who you were but you didn't at least know my name

She sees the memorbilla of Xenos around his house.

Kassiea: So your a fan of Xenos I see

Max(puts head down): you mean was a big fan

She goes on to tell Max that she know about the people he killed and that he should stop if not for his self then at least for Xenos. She tails him the cyvolters could use a hand

Besides cuting the tail of Leona after Xenos tells him to Max killed his first victim by accident as he droped the person he was intergating his second was intentional set up by a false lead from his first victim. His third was inderctly by helping Minia and Jax. The forth his was framed after promising he wouold stop killing and last was Kyshumu

After saving Minia Kassiea will step in to lead the cyvolters seeing the need for leadership. She will do what she felt she should have did along time ago rather than hiding. She defects and turns her hub/satellite/subnet into the base of opperations for the cyvolters. She tells her team to leave or stay as they defend Minia. To Kassiea's surprise Minia still rejects the offer to join the Cyvolters choosing instead to change the system from within. She is cleared of wrong using the evince found from Max's CSD. To Kassiea and Mina's surprise Xenos does not presure Mina to join instead he reveals hisself to be everything absolving Minia of her crimes. When Minia asks why he did he tells her that people don't want true justice no matter what you did people would never forgive unless they have a sutible replacement.

The cyvolters reveal that the world is at war and has never been fighting cyber.beast but rather other cybervators. Prisoners enslaved by BluNet

The world has always hated ReNet because of kyshumu and propaganda created by BluNet. Eventually hates BluNet/CyTek after learning about the treatment of prisoners. Prisoners that are forced to fight with the promise of freedom and those that do not comply are turned into cyber.beast controlled and forced to fight regardless 

The cybervator leauge is shut down something kyshumu wanted to do anyway to prevent Max from becoming a cybervator. Making rules like banning humans siting cyber.beast givin by the cyvolters and even cheating in the cyberspace league

In regards to not wanting to allow the citizens to participate{

Minia/Airiona: what are you afraid of?

Kyshumu: everything

Recgonizing Minia's loyalty Kyshumu then goes to shows Minia that this sport is a proxy war. He reveals some things that the cyvolters have already told her as well as some things that contradicts what she was told. Maybe mouments latter the Cyvolters reveal this and more to the entire world
}

When Minia returnrs they clear her of her crimes but return must serve in the newly establised joint millitary of BluNet and ReNet tasked with taking down the cyvolters

Max no longer wants to kill Kyshumu he instead wants to sever the bind he learns Bursun has on Kyshumu

By taking over the CSD of Max so that Minia can become his cybervator she inadvertnly allowed Xenos to recruit him on to the Cyvolters. He is a key cog that the Cyvolters need as they need him to use yaharia's cyber.beast or he has yaharia's cyber.beast. or he was the one that created the software allow humans to synergize with cyber.beast a device he created for his father maybe when he was 5 a device his father ultimatly used to save him


### Alternative

Minia was Kassiea's last experiment who escaped running into the house of Max at the time. In the future she again takes refge at his house and assumes he remebers her after he recgonizes her despite her Airiona disguise. She takes Max's CSD plants maybe plants a virus along with changes his primary cyber.fighter to her instead of Xenos She soon learns that he does not remember her after she brings up the past
