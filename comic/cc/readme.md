## Cyber.Beast(cc) Outline

BluNet as the only true network left as a result of th on going conflict between ReNet and BluNet as BluNet had eventualy stoped being mercinaries instead taking satellites for their self breaking the promise and removing the purpose of Renet taking advatange of their power. The back and fourth of taking satellites eventually lead to the collapse of ever network except BluNet

Given that ReNet is centralized and back by the last nation on earth destablizing them is as simple as destabilizing that nation. Making it's people hate it's nation. This was why the cyvolters was created witin ReNet and Kyshumu was turned into the leader. Those on earth begins to affiliate ReNet with the cyvolters. The ReNet citzens begin to hate Kyshumu as well as ReNets

BluNet has continued spread the rumor that ReNet has threaten to withdraw protection from the threat of cyber.beast. In reality cyber.beast at this point had not appeared in years.

They also expose the flaws within ReNets foundational sport. Humans prevented from competing(max a citzen of earth and all human being banned even thoose that are citzens of ReNet). The riging of the sport ensuring that those that lose a satellite within the war also lose a satellite within the sport even though satellites have noting to do with the sport(Minia making it to the final despite having only one fan and not being allowed to compete as she is accused of being a cyvolter. With the threat of cyvolters becoming real on earth people on earth lose trust in the Cyvolters leading to man revoking cybervators as body guards). ReNet had allowed BluNet to compete in order to mask the secret war between the 2 networks.

### Part 1
Based on The Battle of Homestead [[1](https://battleofhomestead.org/bhf/the-battle-of-homestead/)], [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_strike)] and the the Football war by which the war is triggered by a sporting match[[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_War)]

Original the plan was to make the cyvolters into the world threat replacing the cyber.beast. Max a citizen of earth takes up the name of eclipse creating cyvolter sympithizers to get revenge on ReNet sparking the civil war between humans and cybervators. BluNet change course and secretly aid the cyvolters by sending cybervators of their own diguised as converted recruits at the same time they create propaganda so that the world will be more accepting of the cyvolters. Eclipse is turned into the worlds enemy and the cyvolters the savior this draws the last of the ReNet supporters to switch thier aligence to the cyvoltors. The Cyvolters form an allience with BluNet know lead by Tomasina for the first time truly uniting the world with Kyshumu gone Tomasina becomes the world leader and 00 remains in the shadows.

- ReNet has now made it illegal for citizens to compete in the CNS this furthurs tensions between ReNet and its members

- Kassiea was only supposed to inform the world of the war but her guilty concious leads her to reveal mis treatment of cybervators as well. To cover the concpicay they tell the world that half of what they said was true that they had been fight a secret war but only in an efort to liberate ReNets people afording them the freedom that all humans should have and opening yet another border by which all can move freely. They tell them that however the fact that they had been controlling cybervators is false narative created by the Cyvolters to build distrust. That  it is imposible to control cybervators. 

- Krocmer a human that few knew was also a blue.type cybervator who inherited Cytek from his father

- Kyshumu's daugther killed he blames Xenos and the Cyvolters and declares war against CyTek after Airiona is arrested to make and example of her for the rest of the Cyvolters who has been chaotic to this point
 
- Kyshumu is unable to cut off the tails of Cyvolters he asks the NRA for permission to kill members of as the fact that the Cyvolters are able and willing to kill has givin them an advantage

- Kyshumu revokes ReNet protection from Citizens that is assumed to be aiding or supporting the Cyvolters in anyway. This backfires instead further angering the citizens.
 
- This is Xenos' last season before he announces his retirement
	
	- Xenos gives a retirement speech before declaring himself the leader of the Cyvolters (maybe save this for next season)
		
		Xenos: I want the future to be a world were there are no distinctions between citizen and cybervator one in which everyone is a cybervator in their on right.
			
		Xenos: Up to this point Cyvolters has not had a leader. Because of this they have done some things I am not proud. many if which goes against the vision/values of the Cyvolter. Without a leader the Cyvolters will become nothing more than an organization resembling a chicken without a head.
		
		A group who is not beholden to a leader will fall into chaos and a leader not beholden to their people will fall into evil
			
		It may be better if this show by using each person as an example rather than told {
		
		Xenos:
			
		Right now There are 4 types of Cyvolters
			
		The malicious type that just like finding people to take down the worst of them all.
			
		The type that doesn't want to look like the bad guy so they attack others to prove that they are not bad
			
		The one that has reformed and feels it is their duty to fix/save others. This type that does not want others to attack you so they prefer to warn you of repercussions
			
		Then there ones that follows(majority) the crowd doing what seems to be what's cool. This type is easily embarrassed and just wants others to fit in
		
		}
		if(they win) Xenos: even though we lost today I wont give up on helping the Cyvolters mission of creating a world with equal opportunity for all. We have technology but sometime society needs that final push
		
		Xenos: Cyvolters have become large in number but needs to become unified in voice
		
		Xenos: From this moment forward I will the lead the Cyvolters. Change can happen, has happened and, will happen.
	 
- In the second season years later the Cyvolters is now considered the Citizens league begin to do a type of initiation or point system in which Cybervators(not citizens) must attack "bad" cybervators in order to become a Cyvolter -- it is a rule created by Citizens.
	- Every accept Kyshumu(think it was Xenos) thinks it was Airiona a Cybervator that killed Leona who they think did it in order to join
	- The Cyvolters increase in size has become a detriment to their initial values
	- Since anyone can be a Cyvolter they are doing whatever they want and claim to be apart of the Cyvolters, because of this the Cyvolters realize they need a leader to lay a framework and places that duty upon Xenos.
	- Airiona is upset by the way the other cyvolter are acting she realizes that citizens can be just as bad as cybervator
	- This changes Airiona strengthens belief that the majority of of Cybervators are stupid instead all humans are. Xenos tells her that it actually mob mentality and selfish preservation that cause people to act this way. people don't want to be alone so they follow what they may think is the masses no matter how wrong it maybe to protect their self
	- After this incident the Cyvolter are seen as a massive threat and suspends the CNS in order to turn focus on bringing down the Cyvolters. This leaves many citizens with out a source if income which causes more citizens to join
	- This prompts Xenos to delare himself the leader of the Cyvolters in order to set it ground rules(not killing). Cybervator who mentored under Xenos begens to join the Cyvolters bring their friends along with them
	
- Citizens think Airiona hides her identity in order to disguise her self as a citizen and that by killing a cybervator she was allowed to join

- Maybe after Xenos dies Citizens and cyvolters decides that any Subnets that are not with them are against them which leads most of BluNet to side with the Cyvolters

- Kyshumu is "assainated" allowing Tomasina to become Interim Chief who is also a Cyvolters who works to end the conflict with the Cyvolters pining the blame Eclipse alone. She also promises to allow citizens to join the CNS under ReNet

- When Max learns his name he is told that Makkusu is his fathers name rather than his own 

### Part 2

The world at large never comes to terms with the truth. That the cyvolters were created by BluNet. or that they turned cybervators into cyber.beast

Max Kassiea and Minia begin to covertly stage a coupdetout with the help of Alex and Ace

Now that Citizens can use Cyber.Beast they want power back. With the revolution is in full swing even oppressing cybervators is not enough for them they want to place them all in a collective consciousness.

CyTek allow the cyvolters to take over the world by reinitiating the CNS but this time they cheat to allow the cyvolters to win taking over the world in away that allows them to rebrand as the cyvolters in a precieved fair way. They then use the same rules created in the sport to oppress humans to oppress cybervators instead. 


The sport is created to enourage soldiarity between all color.types. CyTek creates a red team representing the no defuncted network calling them ReNet and BluNet to serve as an opponent. All teams a required to have one of each color.type. All teams however are lead by green.types who serve as coordinators and gunners although none step into the ring they are award the title of cheif if their team wins. Max's goal is to save everyone by capturing their satellites preventing them from being placed in the CC

It is in a tournament that kassiea insist that Max partcipates in since he he both a human a cybervator. Fighting as a human he is threaten to be exposed as a cybervator unless he quits ending his run in the tournament and his chance to become the leader of the world. Max feels that if he is exposed he may spark another civil war like before.

	Max: if you knew who I was. what I did. I don't even deserve to--

	Kassiea: I know exactly who you are. And that's why you're perfect for the job not just to save them but to lead them.

	Ace: Is that all you have to say for your self. After all you did/you need to take resposbility. This. None of this would have happen if it was not for you. The least you can do is save them. 
	Max Forms a team with Harmony and Minia who wears blindes for the first time as it is know required for all cybervators (It's like you and I are one). Alex forms a team with Ace and harmony.

	When Max steps into the ring he reminds everyone of Makkusu and quickly earns a following


Airiona/Minia/Akia tells Minia/Airiona that they may not be able to defeat Jax but she knows who can/has(in reference to Max). Minia/Airiona thinks to herself she must know and tells Max and eclipse is the same person you/we killed him. Airiona/Minia/Akia he's not dead that is just what we need the world to think. We just have one problem we may have to face Tomasina in order to free him

Minia thinks that Jax is helping Bursun because he thinks that he is Xenos. She thinks he is trying to make amends for helping Kyshumu kill the wrong person

Jax tells Minia while fighting Max that he knows that it is not Xenos.

Jax makes the face he makes when he is lying Minia you're lying

his expression becomes more pronounced Jax I'm not lying (max raises an eyebrow)

Max(smiles and thinks to his self or looks at Minia): yep he is definitely lying

Jax then proceeds to attack Max

It is learned that Bursun can see far into future. He has used this ability shift worldlines by suddetly manipulting key contributors of world events. This encourages Citizens to place every Cybervator in a collective consciousness in order to protect the world from a powerfull threat from the future the Matrioshka brain.

Bursun: It was I who pulled all of the strings

Bursun is unable to fully manipulated Makkusu and all throughout he has foiled his plans as he could not see his future

Eventually Bursun learns that he must change world line through Max in or for him to stop having an effect on events

Bursun told Xenos to put Makkusu in the match as he predicted that it would make Jax choke resulting in a win which didnt happen so he had to go to plan b

When max continues to hold back for fear of going bersek Minia screams: "Let go and Remember who you are Max" Minia is about to be attacked but Max unleashes his power saving her.

Max offers to help Bursun defeat the Matrioshka brain by going into a future in which he will not be able to return from. In exchange he will he will free everyone.

Max goes to the future to fight the Matrioshka Brain when he gets their he see sphere so masive the he becomes disourage at first. He eventually is able to penetrate the ball. Unfortatnly there is more than wall he must break through. It is defended by soilders which is much like an immune system. At first he has to fight thousands The Matrioshka eventually realizes that is an ineffeint way to stop Max as he only needed to defeat a few of them before drilling down to the next level. The Matrioshka then pours all of its energy into creating a humanoid with universal level strength. This is when Max Awakens his White Hole ability in order to defeat it. Upon defeat the Matrioshka brain he learns that they too are doing to protect rather than mere greed. The Matrioshka is meant to protect the Universe from the Galatinoids
