**Pages:** 10-12(Prologue/Epilogue)
**Setting:** Cyberspace/Cyber.Hub
**Plot:** Bursun and Yaharia fighting multiple cyberbeast synergising and taming them making the 2 of them the first cybervators. And the only ones to successfully synergise with a cyber.beast without it first being implanted at birth. The story ends with them standing of to fight the remaining cyberbeast with their new abilities

Bursun fights a cyber.beast in a hub/crater he defeats and eating the gem or absorbs it and is enveloped going into burstdrive/hyperdrive mode
Bursun links his tail going into cyberspace defeats the honey badger cyberbeast and opens his eyes and goes into burst drive mode
## Prologue
The first Cyber.Beast appeared in one of the craters that appeared that appeared on the planet. For years no one thought anything of the craters at the time assuming they where no threat that was of course until a giant cyber.beast appeared in randomly wreaking havoc then disappearing after causing widespread damage. It was eventually discovered that these beast wear not from this world and came to be called cyber.beast. With the help of the tailed ones deemed expendable by society they was able to contain these cyber.beast it what is now called hubs. The cyberbeast erupt after getting enough solar energy that takes years to build up. Eventually we learned to harness these cyber.beast and use them from virtually all aspect of a source of energy and most importantly as quantum computers
They had such raw power and no modern weapon worked on it
They discover cyber.beast had an affinity for people with tails so the people with tails was forced to live in these hubs as the cyberbeast attacked them when causing them to evaporate until the virus found bursun who was immune to it
Tail people were stigmatized because once they reached puberty they can see and her thing normal people can't as they would be afraid of cyber.beast only they could see when they had these hallucination their pupils would turn cat like. Many of the would be locked up in a mental ward as their were considered a danger to society. They are imprisoned for the most minor of offenses. For years people thought they were crazy until they started turning into spheres which turned into galatinoids/cyber.beast. However when placed in a vacuum would stay as a spear unless threatened 

Glow portals/holes open in the crater before a seed/fruit appears
They are actually quantum computers and the control center is on the moon cyvars stopped the galinoids from coming by switching the the universe/solar system to that of the helios 
## Act I
Bursun along with other slave are shown placed in a hub/cyberspace
Hundreds of serfs are shown having their tails plugged into a dome/spear shaped machine huge sitting facing outward around it. Inside of the machine is a cyber.beast gem
Hundreds of cybervators are thrown into the crater or place in a circle shaped building that has a glowing beam of light coming from it in which when they are placed in it they fall to the bottom
## Act II
The cyber.beast start eating/going inside of the cybervators that are in the crater
The cyber.beast start eating/going inside of the cybervators in cyberspace after of which their heads are blown off by the slave collar (Slave iron bit) in which they had a collar around the neck and a mask covering the face. The were also shirtless or maybe had a one piece on
Many Tailed people(Peons/serfs/cybervators/miners) die when they turn into shells
Everyones eyes are wide open and screaming before this happens
A cyber.beast tries to take over Bursun
Bursun is enclosed into spear just like the other cybervators he is turned into a cyber.gem, but unlike the other cybervators he erupts from his shell.
Bursun Synergises with the cyber.beast 
## Act III
Bursun fights the remaining cyber.beast in space or in the hub

## Epilogue
Eventually a scientist decided to harness the power of these cyber.beast as a weapon they had no problems with these experiments as people card very little of these people the had a gentic mutation causing them to grow tails in the back of their heads many of them died Bursun was able to harness its power

People thought that these weaponized peon would remain slaves but they were wrong
After Bursun became the first cybervator the few cybervators that was left became the elites of society as they are the only ones that can use them to their full capacity
Or they think they are the elite but are tools of a secret war
