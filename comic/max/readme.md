# Cyber.Beast(Max) outline 
## Theme
**The role sports play in society:**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by throgh the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervator fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a crewman. His resposibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well the only problem is that Max he doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an acient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

## Brainstorm

- Max learns about limiters and realizes that neck/head band
- Spike/Max discovers that the database of hidden history he found included data from the CSDs of Cybervators Yaharia and Bursun. This info hidden was passesd through generation waiting to be used when Citizens was ready for it. Maybe the original invintor of the CSD or spikes ancestor media owner who first created the CNS to make spetical of Cybervator killing Cyber.Beast to cover up the war. This was approiated by Yaharia to create the CNS of today. Once she died Spike became the sol owner
- Painting Makkusu(eclipse) as the bad guy is what makes the citizens accept the cybervators governing them as long as they provide protection from the cyvolters
- People think that wars are won after one side as imposed their will upon the other. Leaving only those that stand with them or indifferent. They think they are bullied into submission afraid of the power they pose. feeling that if they stepped out of line break law of the new enforcers they would incur their wrath. but unbeknownst to them, they are not the losers for they have taken the back seat to prime future generations to revolt against their current oppressors when they least expect long after those of the original conflict is gone.
- Other Cybervators try to use Cyber.Beast on their limbs like Max even going as far as to cut off their limbs to attempt it maybe Spike is the one that attempts this experiment
