## Cyber.Beast(ex) Outline

Now that Citizens can use Cyber.Beast they want power back. With the revolution is in full swing even oppressing cybervators is not enough for them they want to place them all in a collective consciousness.

Airiona/Minia/Akia tells Minia/Airiona that they may not be able to defeat Jax but she knows who can/has(in reference to Max). Minia/Airiona thinks to herself she must know and tells Max and eclipse is the same person you/we killed him. Airiona/Minia/Akia he's not dead that is just what we need the world to think. We just have one problem we may have to face Tomasina in order to free him

Minia thinks that Jax is helping Bursun because he thinks that he is Xenos. She thinks he is trying to make amends for helping Kyshumu kill the wrong person

Jax tells Minia while fighting Max that he knows that it is not Xenos.

Jax makes the face he makes when he is lying Minia you're lying

his expression becomes more pronounced Jax I'm not lying (max raises an eyebrow)

Max(smiles and thinks to his self or looks at Minia): yep he is definitely lying

Jax then proceeds to attack Max

It is learned that Bursun can see far into future. He has used this ability shift worldlines by suddetly manipulting key contributors of world events. This encourages Citizens to place every Cybervator in a collective consciousness in order to protect the world from a powerfull threat from the future the Matrioshka brain.

Bursun: It was I who pulled all of the strings

Bursun is unable to fully manipulated Makkusu and all throughout he has foiled his plans as he could not see his future

Eventually Bursun learns that he must change world line through Max in or for him to stop having an effect on events

Burdun tells Xenos to put Makkusu in the match as he predicted that it would make Jax choke resulting in a win which didnt happen so he had to go to plan b

Max offers to help Bursun defeat the Matrioshka brain by going into a future in which he will not be able to return from. In exchange he will he will free everyone.
