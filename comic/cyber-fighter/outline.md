All citizens are allowed to compete in cyberspace and are allowed to be cornermen if they are good enough. They tend to avoid other cybervator in cyberspace but not Max who actively challenges them. This is because Max uses a special complex contoller giving him complete control of his cyber.beast.

Max tells that it is impossible but Airiona him not he he has this ancient tech he found or learned about

Airiona calls Max to show him ancient tech that he found and goes on about the right full place of citizens. 

Airiona thinks that this is the case because Max invented a type of cyber.beast that allowed Citizens to wield cyber.beast by repurposing the device originally used to control cybervators.

Airiona wants Max to help decrypt the data he found but Max tells that it is not possible as only a Cybervator can read it he goe to get Jax but Airiona tells him that Jax is to much of a big mouth

Airiona: well you said you wouldn't so someone had to do it

Airiona calls Arrock to help them decrypt it.

Aarock wants to to tell the world about what they found

Airiona states that it is not a good idea to tell others about the secrets as it will be to disruptive to the status quo and that there is a reason this information has been hiden here for centuries.

Max is surprised by this as he is a reporter and one would think he would be the first to want to tell everyone. Airiona tells him it is also a reporter job to use good judgement for what can potentially be detrimental if the world knew about it.

Max makes the team as a cybervator but is not allowed to fight they are only allow him to refuel and give advice to fellow cybervator between rounds which includes who what when where and how to substitute his team's cybervators.

- Max shows everyone the tech he created which he calls CyTek and suggest maybe he could sub in for a round or two

  Aarock: Wow I thought what you made before was incredible how do you create this stuff

  Max: I didn't make it. Its I made from some blueprints from the net. A lot of it was unfinished so all I did was make a few modifications

  Max: I call it an Elimter. Normally a Cyber.Beast would be able to synergize with a cybervator thanks to thier tail. Since everbody including cybervators evovled from plants I used a plant to act as the cyber.beast1,2.

  Aarock :so you are basicly sending commands to a beserk cyber.beast like a green cybervator. So it basicly makes you like a Xybrid. 
  
  other.person: what how.

  Max: < Well you see I can also hyperlink with other cybervator see what they are thinking and send comands as well. >

  other.person: you just hyperlinked to me with out a fist bump.

  Max: no I did, during the fight(geting blood) / I did it using the right vibration frequency

  Another commentator says he still has to beat all of the green cybervators within his division

  Airiona begs Max not to forfiet and tells him this is the perfect opportunity to show the world that anyone can be a Cyber.Fighter. Max tells him that he wont and that they will forfiet
  
  Just before Max is about to announce their forfeit Aarock taunts(Airionas request) Max telling him to give up and to get a life as he is not a real Cybervator and suggest that Airiona would make a better Cybervator than him. Max  accepts his challenge

- Airiona tries to help Max out by cheating when Max sees this he responds by essentially coinciding as he stops mid attack so that he does not hit a frozen harmony. this enrages Airiona at this point he decides take matters into his own hands. This is because he thinks Max is working with the nra and recently learned they cheat to maintain the world order

- Towards the end of Airiona's arc he also joins Jax/Max's team which ultimatlly leads to his despair as his arorgance causes his team to lose or nearlly lose in which case he intervines by taking over a Cybertor on the opposing team. Max notices what has happened and in away forfiets the match maybe by interfaring or by not fighting back.
	- If Max does not fight Back then it will be harnmony that goes berserk turning on her own team and/or satellite but Max is able to stop by simply standing in front of her and starts sing maybe a silly song that harmony all ways sings. And later explains why he did it and the way music works.

  Airiona tells Max that he's right and precedes to turn Max into a cyber.beast.

  Airiona: you can tell him Aarock

  Airiona tells Max it is because you have been lied to this entire time. Well remember the limiters we learned about. That head/neck band you are wearing it is not a keepsake it's a restraint. Take it off and I'll free everyone

  Aarock: They fear citizens but they fear your power even more Max

  Max take his head off his head/neck band. Tomasina tells Max not to take it off

  Aarock: You see you are not only a cybervator and not just a xybrid either but rather a berserker. The most dangerous kind of cybervator. 

  Aarock: Berserkers are rare but The chance that a Berserker is born increase 20 fold when a Cybervator has a child with a citizen which is why marriages between the two is prohibited.

  Max: Are you saying? Noo no no I don't believe you no I refuse to believe you

  Aarock/Airiona: Berserkers are cybervators that do not need to meditate in order to hyperlink with a cyber.beast. which makes them dangrous so they're killed. this is a secret known only by the highest ranked cybervators

  Aarock: This is the world Airiona and I are fighting to fix. We need your help to do. You're the only one who can. Once this is all over will free every not just the Cybervators. I promise.
