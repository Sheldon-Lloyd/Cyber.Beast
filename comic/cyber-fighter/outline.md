All citizens are allowed to compete in cyberspace and are allowed to be cornermen if they are good enough. They tend to avoid other cybervator in cyberspace but not Max who actively challenges them. This is because Max uses a special complex contoller giving him complete control of his cyber.beast.

- Max wakes from his dream sleeping in the middle of the finals of the championship match.

  Max: Amazing where did you get this?
  
  Spike: It was in my father's CSD. No one is supposed know about this though which is why i didn't want Jax to come
  
  Max: of course Jax is the last person I'd expect to keep a secret
  
Max tells Spike that he can decrypt the rest that only a Cybervator would be able to do it
  
Max tells that it is impossible but spike him not he he has this ancient tech he found or learned about

Spike calls Max to show him ancient tech that he found and goes on about the right full place of citizens. 

Spike thinks that this is the case because Max invented a type of cyber.beast that allowed Citizens to wield cyber.beast by repurposing the device originally used to control cybervators.

Spike wants Max to help decrypt the data he found but Max tells that it is not possible as only a Cybervator can read it he goe to get Jax but spike tells him that Jax is to much of a big mouth

Max: huh!? You did what!? 

Spike: well you said you wouldn't so someone had to do it

Spike calls Airiona/Arrock to help them decrypt it.

Aarock/Airiona wants to to tell the world about what they found

Spike states that it is not a good idea to tell others about the secrets as it will be to disruptive to the status quo and that there is a reason this information has been hiden here for centuries.

Max is surprised by this as he is a reporter and one would think he would be the first to want to tell everyone. Spike tells him it is also a reporter job to use good judgement for what can potentially be detrimental if the world knew about it.

Max makes the team as a cybervator but is not allowed to fight they are only allow him to refuel and give advice to fellow cybervator between rounds which includes who what when where and how to substitute his team's cybervators.

- Max shows everyone the tech he created which he calls CyTek and suggest maybe he could sub in for a round or two

  Airiona: Wow I thought what you made before was incredible how do you create this stuff

  Max: I didn't make it. Its I made from some blueprints from the net. A lot of it was unfinished so all I did was make a few modifications

  Max: I call it an Elimter. Normally a Cyber.Beast would be able to synergize with a cybervator thanks to thier tail. Since everbody including cybervators evovled from plants I used a plant to act as the cyber.beast1,2.

  Airiona :so you are basicly sending commands to a beserk cyber.beast like a green cybervator. So it basicly makes you like a Xybrid. 
  
  other.person: what how.

  Max: < Well you see I can also hyperlink with other cybervator see what they are thinking and send comands as well. >

  other.person: you just hyperlinked to me with out a fist bump.

  Max: no I did, during the fight(geting blood) / I did it using the right vibration frequency

  Airiona: This must be the(tech lost to time) lost technology from thousands of years ago Xenos was telling. Haha who Cybervators really are a cancer(find new word) to the world

  With Max's team initially struggling commentators critize their misgivings on the fact that Kyshumu did all of the work
  
  Because of what commentators call neptonism Max is on Leona's team as a center. this however means they don't have a backup mainly because they rarely get injured.
  
  Another commentator says he still has to beat all of the green cybervators within his division

  Spike begs Max not to forfiet and tells him this is the perfect opportunity to show the world that anyone can be a Cyber.Fighter. Max tells him that he wont and that they will forfiet
  
  Just before Max is about to announce their forfeit Aarock taunts(spikes request) Max telling him to give and to get a life as he is not a real Cybervator and suggest that Spike would make a better Cybervator than him. Max  accepts his challenge

  Jax relunactly allows him to do it. Jax tells him to let him handle everything.

- Spike tries to help Max out by cheating when Max sees this he responds by essentially coinciding as he stops mid attack so that he does not hit a frozen harmony. this enrages spike at this point he decides take matters into his own hands. This is because he thinks Max is working with the nra and recently learned they cheat to maintain the world order

- Towards the end of Spike's arc he also joins Jax/Max's team which ultimatlly leads to his despair as his arorgance causes his team to lose or nearlly lose in which case he intervines by taking over a Cybertor on the opposing team. Max notices what has happened and in away forfiets the match maybe by interfaring or by not fighting back.
	- If Max does not fight Back then it will be harnmony that goes berserk turning on her own team and/or satellite but Max is able to stop by simply standing in front of her and starts sing maybe a silly song that harmony all ways sings. And later explains why he did it and the way music works.

  Spike tells Max that he's right and precedes to turn Max into a cyber.beast.

  Spike: you can tell him Airiona

  Spike tells Max it is because you have been lied to this entire time. Well remember the limiters we learned about. That head/neck band you are wearing it is not a keepsake it's a restraint. Take it off and I'll free everyone

  Airiona: They fear citizens but they fear your power even more Max

  Max take his head off his head/neck band. Tomasina tells Max not to take it off

  Airiona: You see you are not only a cybervator and not just a xybrid either but rather a berserker. The most dangerous kind of cybervator. 

  Airiona: Berserkers are rare but The chance that a Berserker is born increase 20 fold when a Cybervator has a child with a citizen which is why marriages between the two is prohibited.

  Max: Are you saying? Noo no no I don't believe you no I refuse to believe you

  Airiona/Spike: Berserkers are cybervators that do not need to meditate in order to hyperlink with a cyber.beast. which makes them dangrous so they're killed. this is a secret known only by the highest ranked cybervators

  Airiona: This is the world Spike and I are fighting to fix. We need your help to do. You're the only one who can. Once this is all over will free every not just the Cybervators. I promise.
