# Cyber.Fighter(Jax) outline
## Brainstorm

- Characters and Roles
  - Spike(Broadcaster/Commentator?), Akia(student/fan) Max(student->cyber.coordinator), Jax(cyber.fighter)  


Jax wakes up from a dream in which both he and Jax both wanted to be a cybervator in the past fighting over who will win between Xenos and /kyshumu. Max is anger at Jax for rooting against his own network. Or Max predicts which network will win angering Jax as he fieels that he is rooting against his own network. The side Max wants to win Jax sees the interview in progress and drags Max down to talk to Xenos and/or Kyshumu. Max bitter about losing tells favored fighter that he does not like him anymore

- Kyshumu/Xenos' CSD registers that Jax/Max is apart of his fandom

- Max wakes up Jax directly or indirectly
  Jax: Why are you talking to my CSD/cyber.beast

- Before Max changed the way the sport is played Cybervators would choose junior cybervators to partner and synergize with. Jax however choose Max to spite the classmates that laughed at Max's dream of becoming a cybervator in a virtual class room setting.

Max goes to the Gym with Jax which is reserved for cybervators

- Leona selects Jax to join her Kyshumu is angry that she didn't invite her own sister

- Instead of attacking a squad/satellite Max and Jax wipes out an entire company/hub by dropping their satellite directly on the companies hub. This includes defeating Kyshumu. Jax only needs to hold Kyshumu off long enough so that Max can hack the hub but losing to their mother in the final match. As cheif creates a rule requiring all cybervators to be paired with at least one degsinated  cyber.coordinator who can be either human or cybervator. She accused of neptuism

- Max forcing Cybervators to fight on earth is allegory for bringing the cybervators down to earth as he makes it into a sport that all can participate in. Satellite's are no longer private property inherited by family and has instead become a public good for all to use to participate in the cybervator league

- While Max and jax is fighting Kyshumu in space

  Max: <alright Jax it's time to execute my plan>

  Jax: <you mean our plan>

  [Flash back to Max explaining the plan]

Kyshumu is to strong to beat head on (in a straight fight)

While you avoid him I will be claring out the area turning it into a theater. That way everwont just have to move out of the way they will want to. So they get to see a cybervator like no one ever has before

Some cybervaator continue to train directly in front of the projection

Crowd: move out of the way we wanna Kyshumu kick this kids butt

Jax: hes gonna think i'm a fraid/coward

Max: that doesnt matter. You remember what he said don't you.

Jax: yea yea yea-- if he wins the champships we will never be able to fight together again

  Kyshumu thinks that Jax is running from him but in reality he is getting position to drop his satellite on the hub of kyshumu and mutiple other cybervators

  Kyshumu: are you running

  Jax: <see I told you he's going to think I'm afraid>

  Jax: Tell me Max are the people watch right now laughing me

  Max:...

  Jax: They are arent they. Oh man I'm gonna be the laughing stock of the league for years to come

  once everyone is out of the way you'll drop your satellite into the middle of the hub turning it from a threater into a stadium

  Kyshumu will be confused at first this will buy me time to use your satellite to hack the hub and all of the satellites connected. When he final comes down to earth you will need to defend the the satellite for the remainder of time that i'll need to take over the hub thus winning this match and the remaining match we need to make it to the championships

- Spike: the two biggest memes of the past two decades are on the same team(refering to Jax running from kyshumu and Kyshumu getting dumped multiple times to lesser men) A picture of all of the cybervator women that rejected with a sad picture of him in the center with the number of women that rejected him on his forehead. They then show the video of Jax running from Kyshumu

- Minia is hated among cybervators no one would team up with her even her own sister as it seems that she only cares about making money and nothing more. Jax is the only one that excepts and decides to work with her

Minia is given a new nick name Airiona

The 10 year anivorsy of Xenos death saving thousands from a cyber.beat is refrenced. This is used as an excuse as to why matches are now fought in space rather than earth

# Act I

## Ordinary world
Kyshumu has Jax as his partner and wins a championship
## Call to adventure
*Timeskip*
Jax wakes from his dream exicited that it is the day he will get to compete in the CNS championships with his own satellite

## Refusal
Leona reminds Jax that he has to choose her as his partner in the upcoming cybervator inintation ceromony with the number 1 draft pick. Since kyshumu won the championships it is customary to give the rewarded satellite to your partner. Since it is an "expansion" satellite they are allowed the first selection of ReNets draft

## Meeting the Mentor
Jax pick Max as his partner. He cite and flashback to how Max helped every step of the way coaching him in cyberspace and giving him advice for his first championship with Kyshumu leting him now how big of a role he played as Kyshumu's partner despite not geting to partner with his mother or another cybervator who would have let him fight. 
In the flashback Kyshumu talks to the disapointed Jax
- Kyshumu: You're a red.type you belong with ReNet. 

  Jax continues to pouting. 

  Kyshumu: You'll thank me later when you have more fans Then you would have ever had with BluNet

## Crossing the threshold
Jax walks into the prep/locker room for ReNets Cybervators for this years championship. Max is stoped by Leona who is standing guard and told that this area is for cyberfighters only. Jax and Leona gets into a fight as he defends Max from the her. Kyshumu stops both of them single handle in the middle off their fight yelling enough and giving Leona dagger eyes as she walks away. He tells Jax not tto make him regret his descion more then he already has(in regards to pick Jax over leona expecting that he will return the favor given that she is maybe arranged to marry him).
