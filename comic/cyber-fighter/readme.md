# Cyber.Beast(Cyber.Fighter) outline 
## Theme
**The role sports play in society:**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Competition vs cooperation, don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Rae participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His resposibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Rae wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Rae doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

All citizens are allowed to compete in cyberspace and are allowed to be cornermen if they are good enough. They tend to avoid other cybervator in cyberspace but not Rae who actively challenges them.

  Max: I didn't make it. Its I made from some blueprints from the net. A lot of it was unfinished so all I did was make a few modifications

  Max: I call it an Elimter. Normally a Cyber.Beast would be able to synergize with a cybervator thanks to thier tail. Since everbody including cybervators evovled from plants I used a plant to act as the cyber.beast1,2.

  Airiona :so you are basicly sending commands to a beserk cyber.beast like a green cybervator. So it basicly makes you like a Xybrid. 
  
  other.person: what how.

  Rae: Some compete for the love of the sport others for the glory/fame or money it brings. There also those that crave power or compete simply for the challenge it brings. For me, those are simply means to an end. At first, I thought I had something to prove to show the world that I could be the best which meant I needed to be the best
  
  Spike: he's just like
  
  [flashback]Bursun: Some fight for the love of the battle others for the glory/fame or money it brings. There also those that crave power or compete simply for the challenge it brings. For me, those are simply means to an end. All I want is to be able to live in peace.
  
  Spike: no he's different.  He wants redefine what it means to be a Cybervator to show everyone that there are no limits.
