﻿## Theme
**The role sports play in society:**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Competition vs cooperation, don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership, greed(wealth,power,fame)

Emotion vs logic(cyber.beast are emotionless and humans have emotion both are able to control each because of the lack or excess of both){Max's cyber.beast however has emotion and Max has less emotion than normal}

Spiritual heart vs logical mind(cyber.beast vs cybervators)

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His responsibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Max doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

Max shows everyone that there is a third option and slowy changes status quo and the rules change accordingly. 

He is the first cybervator to fight with a team that slowly grows starting with he and Aarock/Aarock. Hes fanbase grows rapidly as upon Aarock's suggestion he gives 70% of his bitgems to has fans far more than other cybervators but much like Aarock

When Max joins the fight as the teams support fighter seperating the The cyber.fighter and the cyber.beast when they are on the defense whenever they have a lead. This made it harder for other teams to accumulate points as they have to get through the Cyber.fight standing on the satellite as well as Max controling the detached cyber.beast. Other teams did the same using the code Max opensourced to enable it ensuring such a stategy can not become illegal since anyone can do it. however most teams only employ cybervators not fellow humans to join the team as Max/Airiona/Aarock was hoping would happen. 

Max then starts using more than one color type on his team when Minia joins them. other teams relize the advantage this gives. The rules again change allowing fans to vote for one blue and one red cybervator. This required teams to have 2 red types and 2 blue types on each team in order remain competative. redstributing teams to ensure each team can have at least 2 of each(Airiona thinks they are agian supressing them). 

To acomedated Minia Max splits his team into an offensive and defensive unit giving them yet another advantage thanks to them being able to specialize. Other teams do the same. Aarock finally lets Max fight on offense but not defense allowing him to alternate/rotate with Minia. After Aarock Bites off the tail of a cybervator they agian create an ejection rule.

After all is said and done fans can vote for one blue.type. red.type and green.type. For each match one red and blue cybervator serve as backups and if they are put into play the starter can not come back in. Green types can not apoint a backup. Only green.types/humans are allowed to switch and only with breachers/strikers. This give green.types the option fight if they so choose. This give teams that has a green.type/citizen serving as the center who fight on offense and defense an advantage.

## Notes/Reminders
- forshadow Max power followed by a flash back for reader that might not have noticed

## Brainstorm
- Episodes: 22-52
- Roles
  - Broadcaster/Commentator: Akia, Spike
  - Cornerman/crew: Akia?, Max
  - Cybervator: Jax, Aarock, Ace, Harmony
  - Chief: Kyshumu, Alex  
- Upon leaving Jax's team and joining Max's team Minia is accused by Aarock of sabotaging the team. Max realizes that this is not the case and changes strategy accordingly. He becomes the first to assign offensive and defensive cyber.fighters. Aarock on defense and Minia on offense. This strategy is an adaptation of cybervators copycatting Max strategy to decouple the teams primary Cyber.Beast and instead defend it. This disadvantaged passive fighters like Minia and most other Blue Types. They are better at dogging doing so while defending leaves the Cyber.Beast wide open to attack. The decoupled Cyber.Beast can then act as support and operated by the Cyber.Coordinator
- Max learns about limiters and realizes that neck/head band
- Airiona/Max discovers that the database of hidden history she found included data from the CSDs of Cybervators Yaharia and Bursun. This info hidden was passed through generations waiting to be used when Citizens was ready for it. Maybe the original inventor of the CSD or Airiona's ancestor media owner who first created the CNS to make spetical of Cybervator killing Cyber.Beast to cover up the war. This was appropriated by Yaharia to create the CNS of today. Once she died Airiona became the sol owner
- Painting Max(eclipse) as the bad guy is what makes the citizens accept the cybervators governing them as long as they provide protection from the cyvolters
- People think that wars are won after one side as imposed their will upon the other. Leaving only those that stand with them or indifferent. They think they are bullied into submission afraid of the power they pose. feeling that if they stepped out of line break law of the new enforcers they would incur their wrath. but unbeknownst to them, they are not the losers for they have taken the back seat to prime future generations to revolt against their current oppressors when they least expect long after those of the original conflict is gone.
- Other Cybervators try to use Cyber.Beast on their limbs like Max even going as far as to cut off their limbs to attempt it maybe Airiona is the one that attempts this experiment
- Xenos: If your not striving for progress it wont be guaranteed you will not regress

    Aarock:I was like you once. I was considered one of the best Cyberators. 

    Arrock(punches Akia/Leona and yells):As a Rookie!

   Aarock: I kept my head up looking forward never looking at those behind never giving a second thought to those below me.

   Leona: let me guess you got your butt kicked by one of those people behind you.

   No I never did. Xenos, my Mentor at the time warned me if I rest/sit on my pedestal for to long that it might start to sink. As we all no he was killed by a rouge cyber.beast stronger than I could imagine. I was powerless to help him. I only got in the way. Only If I was stronger I thought If had just listened to his words. That day I learned that you can never have enough power.
- Cybervators start going Berserk for the first time in since Max's parents was killed by Cyber.Beast which Tomasina talks about cutting it short
	- Tomasina: This the first Berserk Cyber.Beast since Mack... (she looks at Max)I mean your parents was killed by one
- Aarock believes that	a cybervator should serve Citizens not the other way around the way how the world currently works
- Max is going to change the perception of who can be a cybervator in the future will no citizen be designated Cornerman and told they can't be a Cybervator because they will be able to point to Max and say I can. He also changes the way the game is played

- Cybervators start randomly going berserk staring with the retired Cybervators who many don't care about. The world does not start to take these events seriously until free agent and even employed Cybervators are affected. One of the Cybervators that go berserk is Harmony. Another is a council member

- Max joins a team that already has Kassiea Aarock and Aarock and now has enough members to compete but is not allowed do anything but act as support as Aarock at first tells him they need a sniper.
	- All of them wanted to change the status in one way or another for Cybervators and Citzens they are created and lead by Airiona who has yet to have reveal herself although everyone asummes she is older due to her intelligence. Aarock is the only one that knows who he is and stands in place as the owner of the team for Airiona.

- Airiona tells Max that if he wins and become cheif he'll be able change things for a citizens
	
- Airiona's father tells them to cut the feed Tomasina says that they can't Kyshumu responds saying that he knows how to cut the feed and heads into combat Tomasina is fustrated but follows to Aid Kyshumu

Max continously ignores Airiona but not listening to her but obeys her as CyKo. This prompts her to disguise his self as Speeding bullet

Airiona tries to bite offf more than she can chew as opposed to Max that works delgently to progress slowly. This is why Airiona resorts to cheating with increasing servarity to progress. She gets worst as she feels victimised by an unfair world and thinks this is the only way to move forward

Since Airiona is not old enough to join she eventually joins as speeding bullet

- Airiona is a kid with high social intelligence who looks up to Max 
  
  It turns out that Airiona was the one leading the cyvolters which surprises everyone but Aarock
  
  At the time of Max becoming a cybervator Airiona becomes his teams first and only fan. Even though Airiona looks up to Max, he does notice and therefore acknowledges Airiona. Aarock/Minia notices this and warns Max that it is responsibility lead.
  
- Max tells Tomasina about his dream after they maybe see him having his nightmare.
  
  It's different every time but this time I was the Cyber.Beast
  
  Tomasina(has a look of supicision):And you think think you killed your Father
  
  Max(waves both his hands): No of course not. It's just that if it wasn't for me
  
  He choose to save you not you
  
  Max's CSD beeps in binary to agree

- upon meeting Max
    - Aarock: I can't believe I never realized it before. You're that kid. The one that interrupted my Xenos' interview just because he beat your favorite Cyber.Fighter.
    - Max: I was a kid
- while fighting Max
    - Aarock: remember that time when interrupted Xenos and challenged him
    - Max: yea but I was just a kid <I didn't know what I was doing>
    - Aarock: Well this is your chance I may not be Xenos but he was my mentor. Imagine that I'm Xenos!

- Airiona flips out after she is discovered and punished for cheating and thinks that Max my lose.
- At first they fight solo in space as only one cybervator is granted the opportunity to defend and fight with a satellite cyber.beast. In cyberspace they fight and against each other and other cyber.beast in order to raise their ranking in hopes of taking the place of that satellites current cyber.fighter/champion.


- Cybervators fight solo in the lead up to the championships. On the other hand Eclipse instead aids each other on the road to the CNS championships. Cybervators avoid this stratagey not because they think it is unsporting but rather because of greed as they would have to share the wealth power or even fame. Eclipse exploits this enabling them to mine more and stronger Cyber.Beast than others. This allows weaker Cybervators to take the back set slowing gaining experence and lowers the risk of losing a cyber.beast having to start over. Although this could also mean an unexperinced cyber.fighter could end up in the championship. This why Aarock and Aarock trains Max

- Although Cybervators team up in the championships they dont exhibit team work as they are all working to be selected to the championships and will only comepete out of greed

- All of the cybervators that join Max's team displays greed in one way or another

	Aarock greed manifest in her stealing cyber.beast from other other cybervator before they have a chance to extract its core. She does this even though she is not the one that fights it.

	Aarock demostrate his hunger for power throygh what he considers honerable. Instead of just hunting cyber.beast he chalanges ofther cybervators for a Cyber.beast even sometime after helping them defeat it. afterwards he takes that cybervators cyber.breast as well if they lose to him. This happens most often to rookies he fight as they are not aware of him yet

- Thinking that Minia needs to toughen up Max/Aarok tells her she needs to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. After she is seen allowing a cyber.beast to beat her up. Max/Aarock question what she is doing
    She said I need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. 
    I'm gonna make myself so uncomfortable that I'm no longer comfortable being uncomfortable
    I don't think that is what she meant
- Jax watches Max in his first fight and thinks he is going to get his self killed and turns away in anger just as he turns away Airiona points out to Jax to look as Max deploys his shield
- While fighting Airiona

  Max(Cries): I'm sorry Airiona This is my fault

  Airiona: Emotions don't work on me Max. That's why I've always looked up to you. You were different from everyone. Thats why I liked you. But then you became a cybervator you changed. Every time you fought I saw a part of you I've never seen before.

  Max(Max smiles wiping Airiona's tears): you've spent so much time ignoring fearing, emotions. You've failed to realize what they have made you become. Look around you and tell Airiona does any of this make any logical sense.

- Minia is shown with her former team talking to her Cyber.Beast after teams around the league has begun to use team work

- Max cooks up a strategy but Minia explains that it might not work and that Torrey is the reason that she gained the reputation of meania during her fresh career as a Cybervator.

  Max: Minia I need your help/Cyber.Beast. I need you to be my shield

  Minia: Torrey Max needs your help

  Torrey: I refuse. I refuse to let anyone but Minia use me. Let alone letting some one ride me

  Max proceeds to fight but is losing

  Minia: Please Torrey

  Torrey: No, I told already I refuse to let anyone but--

  Torrey looks as Max begins taking off his robe

  Torrey: Max use/ride me

  Minia: what did you just say

  Torrey: That I would only let Ma-- 

  Aarock: turns and looks

  Torrey: A Maximumly charged Minia use me

  Minia: that's not what you said

  Torrey: alright I'll do it just-- Just leave alone ok.

- Max while riding asks to use her lance

  Torrey: First you asks to ride me now  you want to take/touch my lance as well

  Max: please Torrey I... Max looks down at Torrey surprised

  hands Max her lance and blushes

  Max(smiles): thanks

- Airiona Just as Airiona begins to become less envious of Minia after learning of up bringing and motivations she learns Mina is using the cyber.beast that killed her father. This turns her diminishing hate into hate.

- Max and mina come home walking close side by side looking at each other laughing and playing with each other indicating a growing relationship. Max sees this and becomes jealous and tells Max that she only only wants to help max but other cybervators and/or citizens join in as well to which max gladly invites them this frustrate Airiona.

- The cyber.beast within the satellite headed by Minia refuses to be used by anyone else despite the fact that everyone else has begun fighting in teams. Because of this she is the only cybervator for her network. This leads other to think she is merely selfish fighting alone so that she cant keep all of her profit to herself. Max takes advantage of the situation initiating a trade

- Max tells Airiona not even the highest ranked cybervator can control yahariah's cyber.best without going berserk
  
  Airiona: well It's a good thing I'm not are Cybervator isn't it.

- Max (explains): The lag between the CSDs controls small but it's big enough to give Cybervators an advantage over people like us. I got around it by coding the movements direct in real-time

- Yahaira: haha that cyber.beast didn't absorb Torey it killed her consciousness just managed to manifest in the closet beacon it could find 

haha that cyber.beast didn't absorb Torey it killed her taking the bitgems fueled by her emotions along with hit her. 

Have ever wondered why white.type cyber.beast are pretty much unusable by most cybervators.

You see cyber.beast are fueled by emotion darker emotions bread and feed black.type cyber.beast the opposite holds true for white.type cyber.beast. This only possible because unlike everything else in the universe emotions are not bound by space nor time. What you see before you is merely a remanence of her love she had for you, nothing more.

- Airiona: A Cyber.Beast's abilities are only limited by the imagination of the wilder. It's potential is wasted on people like Jax

- Society likes to separate everyone into the smart and the dumb. The smart people like to think they are better than everyone else. But they are no different than everyone else when they succumb to their emotions.
