**The Harmony between competition and cooperation**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership, greed(wealth,power,fame)

Playing by the rules{
Don't complaining that the rules are against you or that it is unfair. Don't try breaking pre established rules. Play by the rules win by the rules so that you can set the new standards. This is what Max does as opposed to Spike. This will allow you the chance to see the grass on the other side before judging rather or not the rules that are in place is as bad as you first believed

If you don't like the rules of the game you are playing play by the rules win by the rules then change the game. Your resiliency will inspire others
}
Emotion vs logic(cyber.beast are emotionless and humans have emotion both are able to control each because of the lack or excess of both){Max's cyber.beast however has emotion and Max has less emotion than normal}

Spiritual heart vs logical mind(cyber.beast vs cybervators)

Max just wants to have fun but needs to compete.  He wants to encourage cooperation rather competition among each other. He does this by helping other cybervators rather than fighting them hoping they will return the favor. He must learn that some times you have to fight for what you want rather than relying on others. He must stand by his ideas as he challenges the ideas and traditions of others testing each to see which rises above the other. Such as when he first tries to join ReNet and BluNet expecting they will change them to change for him instead of becoming the change you want to see in the world and inspiring others to follow you cooperate with and top compete with preexisting idea/networks.It is achieve through resiliency through adversity and winning showing the values of your ideas. ReNet an BluNet however both rejects him forcing him to start his own network serving as an allegory for standing by ones ideals
Jax wants to compete to the point of exclusion. He wants to brutality kill max so that max wont die and so that no other cybervator will ever want attempt to join again
Spike's envy leads him compete to the level of winning by all means even if it means cheating and injuring opponents
Bursun like Max wants to cooperate an is an example of taking cooperation to far to the state of tyranny. he shows a world with the absence of competition. His compassion leads him towards tyranny
Minia hates competition to the point of self righteousness. Redistributing wealth to those she thinks deserves it most.He wants to eliminate the CNS championships so that everyone can compete including humans leaving just cyber.beast mining.

Kyshumu  Being at the top he sets the bar for what is possible for a cyber.fighter but helps people doing everything to the point of handicapping them.

Everyone is a leader in their own right
Max lacks strength but leads by example pathing new paths for other to follow along side him. Despite not wanting be a leader he must become one in order to create harmony between humans and cybervators as he has compassion to understand both sides. He must learn that as a person in a poison of power it is his duty be a good citizen. To turn his pedestal into a platform and share with those less fortunate
Bursun paves paths in secrecy and drags other to follow. He leads despite resent his position of being held on the pedestal/platform
Aarock lacks knowledge but leads by pushing others
Minia will on lead those she deems worthy by feeding them (gems) before feeding her self
Kyshumu make people to dependent on him
Xenos left a last impact and no longer needs to be alive to have a impact on other
Spike spends so much time looking up to max he fails to realize he has become a leader as well
Jax is overprotective

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His responsibilities is to aid the Cybervators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Max doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

Max shows everyone that there is a third option and slowly changes status quo and the rules change accordingly. 

He is the first cybervator to fight with a team that slowly grows starting with he and Minia/Aarock. His fanbase grows rapidly as upon Minia's suggestion he gives 80% of his bitgems to has fans far more than other cybervators

Max starts off on his own without a network and with Spike as his cyber.coordinator but builds allies and a team when he starts to help other cybervators in cyber.space. He first defends a cybervator against Aarock who decides to join his team because of this. 

The eclipse dragons provide a UBI for it's citizens/fans to incentivize social good. They are also the first to create a team based champion selection. And are set to prove that you don't need to be a cybervator to participate and that they can even be a benefit to have on a team rather than a detriment. Jax however wants to prove otherwise be defeating Max
