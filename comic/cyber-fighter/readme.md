﻿## Theme
**The role sports play in society:**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Competition vs cooperation, don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership, greed(wealth,power,fame)

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His responsibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Max doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

## Brainstorm
- Episodes: 22-52
- Roles
  - Broadcaster/Commentator: Akia
  - Cornerman/crew: Akia?, Max
  - Cybervator: Jax, Airiona, Ace, Harmony
  - Chief: Kyshumu, Alex  
- Upon leaving Jax's team and joining Max's team Minia is accused by Airiona of sabotaging the team. Max realizes that this is not the case and changes strategy accordingly. He becomes the first to assign offensive and defensive cyber.fighters. Airiona on defense and Minia on offense. This strategy is an adaptation of cybervators copycatting Max strategy to decouple the teams primary Cyber.Beast and instead defend it. This disadvantaged passive fighters like Minia and most other Blue Types. They are better at dogging doing so while defending leaves the Cyber.Beast wide open to attack. The decoupled Cyber.Beast can then act as support and operated by the Cyber.Coordinator
- Max learns about limiters and realizes that neck/head band
- Spike/Max discovers that the database of hidden history he found included data from the CSDs of Cybervators Yaharia and Bursun. This info hidden was passed through generations waiting to be used when Citizens was ready for it. Maybe the original inventor of the CSD or spikes ancestor media owner who first created the CNS to make spetical of Cybervator killing Cyber.Beast to cover up the war. This was appropriated by Yaharia to create the CNS of today. Once she died Spike became the sol owner
- Painting Max(eclipse) as the bad guy is what makes the citizens accept the cybervators governing them as long as they provide protection from the cyvolters
- People think that wars are won after one side as imposed their will upon the other. Leaving only those that stand with them or indifferent. They think they are bullied into submission afraid of the power they pose. feeling that if they stepped out of line break law of the new enforcers they would incur their wrath. but unbeknownst to them, they are not the losers for they have taken the back seat to prime future generations to revolt against their current oppressors when they least expect long after those of the original conflict is gone.
- Other Cybervators try to use Cyber.Beast on their limbs like Max even going as far as to cut off their limbs to attempt it maybe Spike is the one that attempts this experiment
- Xenos: If your not striving for progress it wont be guaranteed you will not regress

    Aarock:I was like you once. I was considered one of the best Cyberators. 

    Arrock(punches Akia/Leona and yells):As a Rookie!

   Aarock: I kept my head up looking forward never looking at those behind never giving a second thought to those below me.

   Leona: let me guess you got your butt kicked by one of those people behind you.

   No I never did. Xenos, my Mentor at the time warned me if I rest/sit on my pedestal for to long that it might start to sink. As we all no he was killed by a rouge cyber.beast stronger than I could imagine. I was powerless to help him. I only got in the way. Only If I was stronger I thought If had just listened to his words. That day I learned that you can never have enough power.
- Cybervators start going Berserk for the first time in since Max's parents was killed by Cyber.Beast which Tomasina talks about cutting it short
	- Tomasina: This the first Berserk Cyber.Beast since Mack... (she looks at Max)I mean your parents was killed by one
- Airiona believes that	a cybervator should serve Citizens not the other way around the way how the world currently works
- Max is going to change the perception of who can be a cybervator in the future will no citizen be designated Cornerman and told they can't be a Cybervator because they will be able to point to Max and say I can. He also changes the way the game is played

- Cybervators start randomly going berserk staring with the retired Cybervators who many don't care about. The world does not start to take these events seriously until free agent and even employed Cybervators are affected. One of the Cybervators that go berserk is Harmony. Another is a council member

- Max joins a team that already has Kassiea Aarock and Airiona and now has enough members to compete but is not allowed do anything but act as support as Airiona at first tells him they need a sniper.
	- All of them wanted to change the status in one way or another for Cybervators and Citzens they are created and lead by Spike who has yet to have reveal his self although everyone asummes he is older due to his intelligence. Airiona is the only one that knows who he is and stands in place as the owner of the team for Spike.

- Spike tells Max that if he wins and become cheif he'll be able change things for a citizens
	
- Spikes father tells them to cut the feed Tomasina says that they can't Kyshumu responds saying that he knows how to cut the feed and heads into combat Tomasina is fustrated but follows to Aid Kyshumu

Max continously ignores Spike but not listens to but obeys him as CyKo. This prompts him to disguise his self as Speeding bullet

Spike tries to bite offf more than he can chew as opposed to Max that works delgently to progress slowly. This is why spike resorts to cheating with increasing servarity to progress. He gets worst as he fells victimised by an unfair world and thinks this is the only way to move forward

Since Spike is not old enough to join he eventually joins as speeding bullet

- Spike is a kid with high social intelligence who looks up to Max 
  
  It turns out that Spike was the one leading the cyvolters which surprises everyone but Airiona
  
  At the time of Max becoming a cybervator spike becomes his teams first and only fan. Even though spike looks up to Max, he does notice and therefore acknowledges spike III. Xenos notices this and warns Max that it is responsibility lead.
  
- Max tells Tomaina about his dream after they maybe see him having his nightmare.
  
  It's different every time but this time I was the Cyber.Beast
  
  Tomasina(has a look of supicision):And you think think you killed your Father
  
  Max(waves both his hands): No of course not. It's just that if it wasn't for me
  
  He choose to save you not you
  
  Max's CSD beeps in binary to agree

- upon meeting Max
    - Airiona: I can't believe I never realized it before. You're that kid. The one that interrupted my Xenos' interview just because he beat your favorite Cyber.Fighter.
    - Max: I was a kid
- while fighting Max
    - Airiona: remember that time when interrupted Xenos and challenged him
    - Max: yea but I was just a kid <I didn't know what I was doing>
    - Airiona: Well this is your chance I may not be Xenos but he was my mentor. Imagine that I'm Xenos!

- Spike flips after he is discovered and punished for cheating and thinks that Max my lose.
