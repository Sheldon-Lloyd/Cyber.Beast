**The Harmony between competion and cooperation**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership, greed(wealth,power,fame)

Playing by the rules{
Don't complaining that the rules are against you or that it is unfair. Don't try breaking pre established rules. Play by the rules win by the rules so that you can set the new standards. This is what Max does as opposed to Spike. This will allow you the chance to see the grass on the other side before judging rather or not the rules that are in place iis as bad as you first believed

If you dont like the rules of the game you are playing play by the rules win by the rules then change the game. Your reselincy will inspire others
}
Emotion vs logic(cyber.beast are emotionless and humans have emotion both are able to control each because of the lack or excess of both){Max's cyber.beast however has emotion and Max has less emotion than normal}

Spiritual heart vs logical mind(cyber.beast vs cybervators)

Max wants to cooperate and have fun but needs to compete. He wants to eliminate the CNS championships so that everyone can compete including humans leaving just cyber.beast mining. He wants to encourage cooperation rather competeion amoung each other. He does this by helping other cybervators rather than fighting them hoping they will return the favor. He must learn that some times you have to fight for what you want rather than relying on others. He must stand by his ideas as he chanlanges the ideas and traditions of others testing each to see which rises above the other. Such as when he first trys to join ReNet and BluNet expecting they will change them to change for him instead of becoming the change you wantt to see in the world and inspiring others to follow you cooperate with and top compete with prexisting idea/networks.It is achive through resinlccey through adiversity and winning showing the values of your ideas. ReNet an blunet however both rejects him forcing him to start his own network serving as an alegory for standing by ones ideals
Jax wants to compete to the point of oppression. He wants to brutaily kill max so that max wont die and so that no other cybervator will ever want atemp to join again
Spike wants compete to the level of winning by all means even if it means cheating and injuring opponents
Bursun like Max wants to cooperate an is an example of taking cooperation to far to the state of tyranny. he shows a world with the absence of competetion
Minia will only compete or cooperated when it serves her ends
Kyshumu  Being at the top he sets the bar for what is possible for a cyber.fighter but helps people doing everything to the point of handcaping them.

Everyone is a leader in their own right
Max lacks strength but leads by example pathing new paths for other to follow allong side him. Despite not wanting be a leader he must become one inorder to create harmony between humans and cybervators as he has cmopasion to understand both sides. He must learn that as a person in a posion of power it is his duty be a good citizen. To turn his pedestal into a platform and share with those less forunate
Bursun paves paths in secrect and drags other to follow. He leads despite resent his position of being held on the pedestal/platform
Aarock lacks knowledge bu leads by pushing others
Minia will on lead those she deems worthy by feeding them (gems) before feeding her self
Kyshumu make people to dependent on him
Xenos left a last impact and no longer needs to be alive to have a impact on other
Spike spends so much time looking up to max he fails to realize he has become a leader as well
Jax is overprotective

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His responsibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Max doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

Max shows everyone that there is a third option and slowy changes status quo and the rules change accordingly. 

He is the first cybervator to fight with a team that slowly grows starting with he and Minia/Aarock. His fanbase grows rapidly as upon Minia's suggestion he gives 80% of his bitgems to has fans far more than other cybervators

Max starts off on his own without a network and with Spike as his cyber.coordinator but builds allies and a team when he starts to help other cybervators in cyber.space. He first defends a cybervator against Aarock who decides to join his team because of this. 

The eclipse dragons provide a ubi for it's citizens/fans to incentivise social good. They are also the first to create a team based champion selection. And are set to prove that you don't need to be a cybervator to particpate and that they can even be a benefit to have on a team rather tha a detramint. Jax however wants to prove otherwise be defeating Max

### Character development
  - Ace and Alex backstory
    
    Ace see the whole class laughing at alex and exclaims do they know who I am. I'm Jax with the Renet Lions. I am worth millions. Alex tells ace "no ace they don't"

    This gives Alex the idea to show them who he is and Tells Alex that he will choose him as his partner for the cybervator championships

  - Instead of harmony killing some in the past while going berserk it is Minia. Or Minia is scared because her sister killed someone in the past "That my sister" "You mean to tell me Harmony the one that killed a cybervator while in traing is your sister"

  - Maybe Spike's sibling died while getting their cyber.beast this is why his parents did not allow him to get the procedure
  - Spike also deteriorates  the more he loses power as Eclipse democratizes. He begins to thinks ever is conspiring against him to prevent humans from competing. As the sole fan of the team Spike had the final say for all decisions but as more fans joined that began to change

  - Spike begins to accept Minia after learning about her past which Minia tells Max and Spike about herself after they ask about her scars. This changes when she thinks Minia is cheating or sees Max and minia geting closer. she no longer wavers about starting a war 
- If Minia has twin tail throught the story maybe when she disrobes for the final fight she ties her hair in a pony tail instead signaling a change in characters. As with Aarock suspended and Spike imprisoned she maybe fights on defense allowing Max to fight on offense. At this point she has accepted she does not hate cybervators something Max pointed out when she did not want to hurt her opponent outside of cyberspace.
  - Max: Just remember how much you hate Cybervators

    Minia: But Idon't hate them you said it yourself

    [Flashback to when Minia is placed on offense]

    Max: I don't think you hate Cybervators ~~As much as you think~~


Spike helps Max with the presumed interest of collecting history bits

The more Max wins the more history bits they collect. The more Spike learns about the past the more she resents the present. The more Max wins the more pleasure he enjoys in the present. By stories end Max becomes self indulgent and arrogant while Spike is filled with self pity and envy. They must eventual overcome these faults to work together so they can defeat Bursun. Spike must coordinate both Max and Jax allowing her to make the best of the skills she has. Max must bring Airona back to the side of good by recogonizing his own faults

When Max joins the fight as the teams support fighter seperating the The cyber.fighter and the cyber.beast when they are on the defense whenever they have a lead. This made it harder for other teams to accumulate points as they have to get through the Cyber.fight standing on the satellite as well as Max controling the detached cyber.beast. Other teams did the same using the code Max opensourced to enable it ensuring such a stategy can not become illegal since anyone can do it. however most teams only employ cybervators not fellow humans to join the team as Max/Spike/Aarock was hoping would happen. 

Max then starts using more than one color type on his team when Minia joins them. other teams relize the advantage this gives. The rules again change allowing fans to vote for one blue and one red cybervator. This required teams to have 2 red types and 2 blue types on each team in order remain competative. redstributing teams to ensure each team can have at least 2 of each(Spike thinks they are agian supressing them). 

To acomedated Minia Max splits his team into an offensive and defensive unit giving them yet another advantage thanks to them being able to specialize. Other teams do the same. Aarock finally lets Max fight on offense but not defense allowing him to alternate/rotate with Minia. After Aarock Bites off the tail of a cybervator they agian create an ejection rule.

After all is said and done fans can vote for one blue.type. red.type and green.type. For each match one red and blue cybervator serve as backups and if they are put into play the starter can not come back in. Green types can not apoint a backup. Only green.types/humans are allowed to switch and only with breachers/strikers. This give green.types the option fight if they so choose. This give teams that has a green.type/citizen serving as the center who fight on offense and defense an advantage.

## Notes/Reminders
- Max is Blue and Jax is Red because Mack is from earth and carries both red and blue type genes
- foreshadow Max power followed by a flash back for reader that might not have noticed
- Eclipse must use a uniform the uniform because they can't afford a full-body one
- They must destroy the satellite controlling the cybervators
- Spike will not only to be forgiven by Max but the world as well even after taking down kyshumu who is considered by most as the G.O.A.T of the CNS.
  - Show her current and past suffering from the beginning maybe she is bullied for her dream of being a cybervator. Later she can be shown heart broken over failing the gene screen as well as morning her father she barley remembers. The fact she remembers him at all surprises Kassiea/Aarock
  - she must expose the flaws of the world providing a reason for her actions. That she and many others in the world resent cybervators. She makes question rather this is the way the world should be. That the cybervators have lost what it means to lead. It must be something that many if not most in the world agree with
  - show her helping other humans who are 80% of society as a way to show her kindness. It at also will help her be seen as more charismatic as will be able understand that she wants to help them
  - Hiding her speeding identity from the world as the secret benefactor for Max. The fact the she is a child will make society more forgiving of her actions for those against her and will make those that supported her turn away as they will feel tricked.
  - show that Spike feels remorse as she begins to doubt her self and then finally saving/protect not only Max but the other cybervators from Bursun. It will initially look like she is attack them but she is instead saving them sacrificing maybe her fathers cyber.beast in the process at the same time identity is exposed leaving her vulnerable.
  - Justify her downward spiral She goes all in after seeing Max is not only a cybervator but was the one that killed her father. She is pushed over the edge when she thinks Mina who she already hates is cheating
  - show her being mislead and misleading others such as believing that she is being cheated leading other to think the same
  - She realizes the world she thought she wanted is not what she actually wanted
## Brainstorm
- Episodes: 22-52
- Roles
  - Broadcaster/Commentator: Akia, Spike
  - Cornerman/crew: Akia?, Max
  - Cybervator: Jax, Aarock, Ace, Harmony
  - Chief: Kyshumu, Alex  

- Painting Max(eclipse) as the bad guy is what makes the citizens accept the cybervators governing them as long as they provide protection from the cyvolters
- People think that wars are won after one side as imposed their will upon the other. Leaving only those that stand with them or indifferent. They think they are bullied into submission afraid of the power they pose. feeling that if they stepped out of line break law of the new enforcers they would incur their wrath. but unbeknownst to them, they are not the losers for they have taken the back seat to prime future generations to revolt against their current oppressors when they least expect long after those of the original conflict is gone.

- Minia is shown with her former team talking to her Cyber.Beast after teams around the league has begun to use team work

- Max cooks up a strategy but Minia explains that it might not work and that Torrey is the reason that she gained the reputation of meania during her fresh career as a Cybervator.

  Max: Minia I need your help/Cyber.Beast. I need you to be my shield

  Minia: Torrey Max needs your help

  Torrey: I refuse. I refuse to let anyone but Minia use me. Let alone letting some one ride me

  Max proceeds to fight but is losing

  Minia: Please Torrey

  Torrey: No, I told already I refuse to let anyone but--

  Torrey looks as Max begins taking off his robe

  Torrey: Max use/ride me

  Minia: what did you just say

  Torrey: That I would only let Ma-- 

  Aarock: turns and looks

  Torrey: A Maximumly charged Minia use me

  Minia: that's not what you said

  Torrey: alright I'll do it just-- Just leave me alone ok.

- Max while riding asks to use her lance

  Torrey: First you asks to ride me now you want to take/touch my lance as well

  Max: please Torrey I... Max looks down at Torrey surprised

  hands Max her lance and blushes

  Max(smiles): thanks

- Spike Just as Spike begins to become less envious of Minia after learning of up bringing and motivations she learns Mina is using the cyber.beast that killed her father. This turns her diminishing hate into hate.

- Max and mina come home walking close side by side looking at each other laughing and playing with each other indicating a growing relationship. Max sees this and becomes jealous and tells Max that she only only wants to help max but other cybervators and/or citizens join in as well to which max gladly invites them this frustrate Spike.

- The cyber.beast within the satellite headed by Minia refuses to be used by anyone else despite the fact that everyone else has begun fighting in teams. Because of this she is the only cybervator for her network. This leads other to think she is merely selfish fighting alone so that she cant keep all of her profit to herself. Max takes advantage of the situation initiating a trade
