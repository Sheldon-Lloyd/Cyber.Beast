**The Harmony between competion and cooperation**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership, greed(wealth,power,fame)

Playing by the rules{
Don't complaining that the rules are against you or that it is unfair. Don't try breaking pre established rules. Play by the rules win by the rules so that you can set the new standards. This is what Max does as opposed to Spike. This will allow you the chance to see the grass on the other side before judging rather or not the rules that are in place iis as bad as you first believed

If you dont like the rules of the game you are playing play by the rules win by the rules then change the game. Your reselincy will inspire others
}
Emotion vs logic(cyber.beast are emotionless and humans have emotion both are able to control each because of the lack or excess of both){Max's cyber.beast however has emotion and Max has less emotion than normal}

Spiritual heart vs logical mind(cyber.beast vs cybervators)

Max wants to cooperate and have fun but needs to compete. He wants to eliminate the CNS championships so that everyone can compete including humans leaving just cyber.beast mining. He wants to encourage cooperation rather competeion amoung each other. He does this by helping other cybervators rather than fighting them hoping they will return the favor. He must learn that some times you have to fight for what you want rather than relying on others. He must stand by his ideas as he chanlanges the ideas and traditions of others testing each to see which rises above the other. Such as when he first trys to join ReNet and BluNet expecting they will change them to change for him instead of becoming the change you wantt to see in the world and inspiring others to follow you cooperate with and top compete with prexisting idea/networks.It is achive through resinlccey through adiversity and winning showing the values of your ideas. ReNet an blunet however both rejects him forcing him to start his own network serving as an alegory for standing by ones ideals
Jax wants to compete to the point of oppression. He wants to brutaily kill max so that max wont die and so that no other cybervator will ever want atemp to join again
Spike wants compete to the level of winning by all means even if it means cheating and injuring opponents
Bursun like Max wants to cooperate an is an example of taking cooperation to far to the state of tyranny. he shows a world with the absence of competetion
Minia will only compete or cooperated when it serves her ends
Kyshumu  Being at the top he sets the bar for what is possible for a cyber.fighter but helps people doing everything to the point of handcaping them.

Everyone is a leader in their own right
Max lacks strength but leads by example pathing new paths for other to follow allong side him. Despite not wanting be a leader he must become one inorder to create harmony between humans and cybervators as he has cmopasion to understand both sides. He must learn that as a person in a posion of power it is his duty be a good citizen. To turn his pedestal into a platform and share with those less forunate
Bursun paves paths in secrect and drags other to follow. He leads despite resent his position of being held on the pedestal/platform
Aarock lacks knowledge bu leads by pushing others
Minia will on lead those she deems worthy by feeding them (gems) before feeding her self
Kyshumu make people to dependent on him
Xenos left a last impact and no longer needs to be alive to have a impact on other
Spike spends so much time looking up to max he fails to realize he has become a leader as well
Jax is overprotective

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His responsibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Max doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

Max shows everyone that there is a third option and slowy changes status quo and the rules change accordingly. 

He is the first cybervator to fight with a team that slowly grows starting with he and Minia/Aarock. His fanbase grows rapidly as upon Minia's suggestion he gives 80% of his bitgems to has fans far more than other cybervators

Max starts off on his own without a network and with Spike as his cyber.coordinator but builds allies and a team when he starts to help other cybervators in cyber.space. He first defends a cybervator against Aarock who decides to join his team because of this. 

The eclipse dragons provide a ubi for it's citizens/fans to incentivise social good. They are also the first to create a team based champion selection. And are set to prove that you don't need to be a cybervator to particpate and that they can even be a benefit to have on a team rather tha a detramint. Jax however wants to prove otherwise be defeating Max


## Notes/Reminders
- Max is Blue and Jax is Red because Mack is from earth and carries both red and blue type genes
- foreshadow Max power followed by a flash back for reader that might not have noticed
- Eclipse must use a uniform the uniform because they can't afford a full-body one
- They must destroy the satellite controlling the cybervators
- Spike will not only to be forgiven by Max but the world as well even after taking down kyshumu who is considered by most as the G.O.A.T of the CNS.
  - Show her current and past suffering from the beginning maybe she is bullied for her dream of being a cybervator. Later she can be shown heart broken over failing the gene screen as well as morning her father she barley remembers. The fact she remembers him at all surprises Kassiea/Aarock
  - she must expose the flaws of the world providing a reason for her actions. That she and many others in the world resent cybervators. She makes question rather this is the way the world should be. That the cybervators have lost what it means to lead. It must be something that many if not most in the world agree with
  - show her helping other humans who are 80% of society as a way to show her kindness. It at also will help her be seen as more charismatic as will be able understand that she wants to help them
  - Hiding her speeding identity from the world as the secret benefactor for Max. The fact the she is a child will make society more forgiving of her actions for those against her and will make those that supported her turn away as they will feel tricked.
  - show that Spike feels remorse as she begins to doubt her self and then finally saving/protect not only Max but the other cybervators from Bursun. It will initially look like she is attack them but she is instead saving them sacrificing maybe her fathers cyber.beast in the process at the same time identity is exposed leaving her vulnerable.
  - Justify her downward spiral She goes all in after seeing Max is not only a cybervator but was the one that killed her father. She is pushed over the edge when she thinks Mina who she already hates is cheating
  - show her being mislead and misleading others such as believing that she is being cheated leading other to think the same
  - She realizes the world she thought she wanted is not what she actually wanted
