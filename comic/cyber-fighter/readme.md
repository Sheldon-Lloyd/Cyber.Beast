﻿## Theme
**The role sports play in society:**
Sports building character teaching people to not look at their self as victims when confronted with someone ahead they will look at it as an opportunity for improvement a new target to set as a goal that can be surpassed instead of oppressing/stepping on other or cheating to get ahead as this removes the meaning of life. Citizen who have not had the chance to be cybervator inherit this problem.
### Sub-themes
Competition vs cooperation, don't bite off more than you can chew, leadership, greed(wealth,power,fame)

Emotion vs logic(cyber.beast are emotionless and humans have emotion both are able to control each because of the lack or excess of both){Max's cyber.beast however has emotion and Max has less emotion than normal}

Spiritual heart vs logical mind(cyber.beast vs cybervators)

## Plot
This is a united world in which there is no longer any wars. Peace is maintain by through the CNS league -- a sport in which Cybervators fight each other harness a technology called Cyber.Beast. These Cyber.Beast allow them to perform breathtaking speed, backbreaking/bone crushing strength and unique abilities that defy belief.

Of 3 out of 5 Cyber.Fighters are green as 2 green Cybervators are needed at minimum since a strategist is need even when a green cybervator is in the field of play.

Max participates in the CNS as well but as a strategist/crewman. His responsibilities is to aid the Cyebrvators that compete in this league. However this is not enough for him. Max wants to be a fighter as well. There is only one problem, Max doesn't have a tail.

Tails are what allows Cybervator to fuse with Cyber.Beast, without one it is impossible to be a Cybervator. However that all changes when he stumbles across an ancient technology hidden away along with all of its secrets.

Max shows everyone that there is a third option and slowy changes status quo and the rules change accordingly. 

He is the first cybervator to fight with a team that slowly grows starting with he and Minia/Aarock. His fanbase grows rapidly as upon Minia's suggestion he gives 70% of his bitgems to has fans far more than other cybervators

### Character development

  - Airiona begins to accept Minia after learning about her past which Minia tells Max and Airiona about after they ask about her scars. This changes when she thinks Minia is cheating or sees Max and minia geting closer. she no longer wavers about starting a war 

- If Minia has twin tail throught the story maybe when she disrobes for the final fight she ties her hair in a pony tail instead signaling a change in characters. As with Aarock suspened and Airiona inprisoned she maybe fights on defense allowing Max to fight on offense. At this point she has accepted she does not hate cybervators something Max pointed out when she did not want to hurt her opponent outside of cyberspace.
  - Max: Just remember how much you hate Cybervators

    Minia: But Idon't hate them you said it yourself

    [Flashback to when Minia is placed on offense]

    Max: I don't think you hate Cybervators ~As much as you think~


Airiona helps Max with the presumed interest of collecting history bits

The more Max wins the more history bits they collect. The more Airiona learns about the past the more she resents the present. The more Max wins the more pleasure he enjoys in the present. By stories end Max becomes self indulgent and arrogant while Airiona is filled with self pity and envy. They must eventual overcome these faults to work together so they can defeat Bursun. Airiona must coordinate both Max and Jax allowing her to make the best of the skills she has. Max must bring Airona back to the side of good by recogonizing his own faults

When Max joins the fight as the teams support fighter seperating the The cyber.fighter and the cyber.beast when they are on the defense whenever they have a lead. This made it harder for other teams to accumulate points as they have to get through the Cyber.fight standing on the satellite as well as Max controling the detached cyber.beast. Other teams did the same using the code Max opensourced to enable it ensuring such a stategy can not become illegal since anyone can do it. however most teams only employ cybervators not fellow humans to join the team as Max/Airiona/Aarock was hoping would happen. 

Max then starts using more than one color type on his team when Minia joins them. other teams relize the advantage this gives. The rules again change allowing fans to vote for one blue and one red cybervator. This required teams to have 2 red types and 2 blue types on each team in order remain competative. redstributing teams to ensure each team can have at least 2 of each(Airiona thinks they are agian supressing them). 

To acomedated Minia Max splits his team into an offensive and defensive unit giving them yet another advantage thanks to them being able to specialize. Other teams do the same. Aarock finally lets Max fight on offense but not defense allowing him to alternate/rotate with Minia. After Aarock Bites off the tail of a cybervator they agian create an ejection rule.

After all is said and done fans can vote for one blue.type. red.type and green.type. For each match one red and blue cybervator serve as backups and if they are put into play the starter can not come back in. Green types can not apoint a backup. Only green.types/humans are allowed to switch and only with breachers/strikers. This give green.types the option fight if they so choose. This give teams that has a green.type/citizen serving as the center who fight on offense and defense an advantage.

## Notes/Reminders
- foreshadow Max power followed by a flash back for reader that might not have noticed
- Eclipse must use a uniform the uniform because they can't afford a full-body one
- They must destroy the satellite controlling the cybervators
- Airiona will not only to be forgiven by Max but the world as well even after taking down kyshumu who is considered by most as the G.O.A.T of the CNS.
  - Show her current and past suffering from the beginning maybe she is bullied for her dream of being a cybervator. Later she can be shown heart broken over failing the gene screen as well as morning her father she barley remembers. The fact she remembers him at all surprises Kassiea/Aarock
  - she must expose the flaws of the world providing a reason for her actions. That she and many others in the world resent cybervators. She makes question rather this is the way the world should be. That the cybervators have lost what it means to lead. It must be something that many if not most in the world agree with
  - show her helping other humans who are 80% of society as a way to show her kindness. It at also will help her be seen as more charismatic as will be able understand that she wants to help them
  - Hiding her speeding identity from the world as the secret benefactor for Max. The fact the she is a child will make society more forgiving of her actions for those against her and will make those that supported her turn away as they will feel tricked.
  - show that Airiona feels remorse as she begins to doubt her self and then finally saving/protect not only Max but the other cybervators from Bursun. It will initially look like she is attack them but she is instead saving them sacrificing maybe her fathers cyber.beast in the process at the same time identity is exposed leaving her vulnerable.
  - Justify her downward spiral She goes all in after seeing Max is not only a cybervator but was the one that killed her father. She is pushed over the edge when she thinks Mina who she already hates is cheating
  - show her being mislead and misleading others such as believing that she is being cheated leading other to think the same
  - She realizes the world she thought she wanted is not what she actually wanted
## Brainstorm
- Episodes: 22-52
- Roles
  - Broadcaster/Commentator: Akia, Spike
  - Cornerman/crew: Akia?, Max
  - Cybervator: Jax, Aarock, Ace, Harmony
  - Chief: Kyshumu, Alex  
- All citizens are allowed to compete in cyberspace and are allowed to be cornermen if they are good enough. They tend to avoid other cybervator in cyberspace but not Max who actively challenges them. This is because Max uses a special complex contoller giving him complete control of his cyber.beast.
- Upon leaving Jax's team and joining Max's team Minia is accused by Airiona of sabotaging the team. Max realizes that this is not the case and changes strategy accordingly. He becomes the first to assign offensive and defensive cyber.fighters. Aarock on defense and Minia on offense. This strategy is an adaptation of cybervators copycatting Max strategy to decouple the teams primary Cyber.Beast and instead defend it. This disadvantaged passive fighters like Minia and most other Blue Types. They are better at dogging doing so while defending leaves the Cyber.Beast wide open to attack. The decoupled Cyber.Beast can then act as support and operated by the Cyber.Coordinator
- Max learns about limiters and realizes that neck/head band
- Airiona/Max discovers that the database of hidden history she found included data from the CSDs of Cybervators Yaharia and Bursun. This info hidden was passed through generations waiting to be used when Citizens was ready for it. Maybe the original inventor of the CSD or Airiona's ancestor media owner who first created the CNS to make spetical of Cybervator killing Cyber.Beast to cover up the war. This was appropriated by Yaharia to create the CNS of today. Once she died Airiona became the sol owner
- Painting Max(eclipse) as the bad guy is what makes the citizens accept the cybervators governing them as long as they provide protection from the cyvolters
- People think that wars are won after one side as imposed their will upon the other. Leaving only those that stand with them or indifferent. They think they are bullied into submission afraid of the power they pose. feeling that if they stepped out of line break law of the new enforcers they would incur their wrath. but unbeknownst to them, they are not the losers for they have taken the back seat to prime future generations to revolt against their current oppressors when they least expect long after those of the original conflict is gone.
- Other Cybervators try to use Cyber.Beast on their limbs like Max even going as far as to cut off their limbs to attempt it maybe Airiona is the one that attempts this experiment

- Xenos: If your not striving for progress it wont be guaranteed you will not regress. If you spend to much time looking down on others you will fail to see your own weaknesses-bakugo

- Tomasina: This the first Berserk Cyber.Beast since Mack... (she looks at Max)I mean your parents was killed by one
- Aarock believes that	a cybervator should serve Citizens not the other way around the way how the world currently works
- Max is going to change the perception of who can be a cybervator in the future will kids like Max won't be designated Cornerman and told they can't be a Cybervator because they will be able to point to Max and say I can. He also changes the way the game is played

- Cybervators start randomly going berserk staring with the retired Cybervators who many don't care about. The world does not start to take these events seriously until free agent and even employed Cybervators are affected. One of the Cybervators that go berserk is Harmony. Another is a council member

- Max joins a team that already has Kassiea Aarock and Aarock and now has enough members to compete but is not allowed do anything but act as support as Aarock at first tells him they need a sniper.
	- All of them wanted to change the status in one way or another for Cybervators and Citzens they are created and lead by Airiona who has yet to have reveal herself although everyone asummes she is older due to her intelligence. Aarock is the only one that knows who he is and stands in place as the owner of the team for Airiona.

- Airiona tells Max that if he wins and become cheif he'll be able change things for a citizens
	
- Airiona's father tells them to cut the feed Tomasina says that they can't Kyshumu responds saying that he knows how to cut the feed and heads into combat Tomasina is fustrated but follows to Aid Kyshumu

Max continously ignores Airiona but not listening to her but obeys her as CyKo. This prompts her to disguise his self as Speeding bullet

Airiona tries to bite offf more than she can chew as opposed to Max that works delgently to progress slowly. This is why Airiona resorts to cheating with increasing servarity to progress. She gets worst as she feels victimised by an unfair world and thinks this is the only way to move forward

Since Airiona is not old enough to join she eventually joins as speeding bullet

- Airiona is a kid with high intelligence who looks up to Max 
  
  It turns out that Airiona was the one leading the cyvolters which surprises everyone but Aarock
  
  At the time of Max becoming a cybervator Airiona becomes his teams first and only fan. Even though Airiona looks up to Max, he does notice and therefore acknowledges Airiona. Aarock/Minia notices this and warns Max that it is responsibility lead.
  
- Max tells Tomasina about his dream after they maybe see him having his nightmare.
  
  It's different every time but this time I was the Cyber.Beast
  
  Tomasina(has a look of supicision):And you think think you killed your Father
  
  Max(waves both his hands): No of course not. It's just that if it wasn't for me
  
  He choose to save you not you
  
  Max's CSD beeps in binary to agree

- upon meeting Max
    - Aarock: I can't believe I never realized it before. You're that kid. The one that interrupted Xenos' interview just because he beat your favorite Cyber.Fighter.
    - Max: I was a kid
- while fighting Max
    - Aarock: remember that time when interrupted Xenos and challenged him
    - Max: yea but I was just a kid <I didn't know what I was doing>
    - Aarock: Well this is your chance I may not be Xenos but he was my mentor. Imagine that I'm Xenos!

- Airiona flips out after she is discovered and punished for cheating and thinks that Max my lose.
- At first they fight solo in space as only one cybervator is granted the opportunity to defend and fight with a satellite cyber.beast. In cyberspace they fight and against each other and other cyber.beast in order to raise their ranking in hopes of taking the place of that satellites current cyber.fighter/champion.


- Cybervators fight solo in the lead up to the championships. On the other hand Eclipse instead aids each other on the road to the CNS championships. Cybervators avoid this stratagey not because they think it is unsporting but rather because of greed as they would have to share the wealth power or even fame. Eclipse exploits this enabling them to mine more and stronger Cyber.Beast than others. This allows weaker Cybervators to take the back set slowing gaining experence and lowers the risk of losing a cyber.beast having to start over. Although this could also mean an unexperinced cyber.fighter could end up in the championship. This why Aarock and Aarock trains Max


- Although Cybervators team up in the championships they dont exhibit team work as they are all working to be selected to the championships and will only comepete out of greed

- All of the cybervators that join Max's team displays greed in one way or another

	Aarock greed manifest in her stealing cyber.beast from other other cybervator before they have a chance to extract its core. She does this even though she is not the one that fights it.

	Aarock demostrate his hunger for power throygh what he considers honerable. Instead of just hunting cyber.beast he chalanges ofther cybervators for a Cyber.beast even sometime after helping them defeat it. afterwards he takes that cybervators cyber.breast as well if they lose to him. This happens most often to rookies he fight as they are not aware of him yet

- Thinking that Minia needs to toughen up Max/Aarok tells her she needs to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. After she is seen allowing a cyber.beast to beat her up. Max/Aarock question what she is doing
    She said I need to be comfortable with being uncomfortable. 
    I'm gonna make myself so uncomfortable that I'm no longer comfortable being uncomfortable
    I don't think that is what she meant
- Jax watches Max in his first fight and thinks he is going to get his self killed and turns away in anger just as he turns away Airiona points out to Jax to look as Max deploys his shield

- Minia is shown with her former team talking to her Cyber.Beast after teams around the league has begun to use team work

- Max cooks up a strategy but Minia explains that it might not work and that Torrey is the reason that she gained the reputation of meania during her fresh career as a Cybervator.

  Max: Minia I need your help/Cyber.Beast. I need you to be my shield

  Minia: Torrey Max needs your help

  Torrey: I refuse. I refuse to let anyone but Minia use me. Let alone letting some one ride me

  Max proceeds to fight but is losing

  Minia: Please Torrey

  Torrey: No, I told already I refuse to let anyone but--

  Torrey looks as Max begins taking off his robe

  Torrey: Max use/ride me

  Minia: what did you just say

  Torrey: That I would only let Ma-- 

  Aarock: turns and looks

  Torrey: A Maximumly charged Minia use me

  Minia: that's not what you said

  Torrey: alright I'll do it just-- Just leave me alone ok.

- Max while riding asks to use her lance

  Torrey: First you asks to ride me now you want to take/touch my lance as well

  Max: please Torrey I... Max looks down at Torrey surprised

  hands Max her lance and blushes

  Max(smiles): thanks

- Airiona Just as Airiona begins to become less envious of Minia after learning of up bringing and motivations she learns Mina is using the cyber.beast that killed her father. This turns her diminishing hate into hate.

- Max and mina come home walking close side by side looking at each other laughing and playing with each other indicating a growing relationship. Max sees this and becomes jealous and tells Max that she only only wants to help max but other cybervators and/or citizens join in as well to which max gladly invites them this frustrate Airiona.

- The cyber.beast within the satellite headed by Minia refuses to be used by anyone else despite the fact that everyone else has begun fighting in teams. Because of this she is the only cybervator for her network. This leads other to think she is merely selfish fighting alone so that she cant keep all of her profit to herself. Max takes advantage of the situation initiating a trade

- Max tells Airiona not even the highest ranked cybervator can control yahariah's cyber.best without going berserk
  
  Airiona: well It's a good thing I'm not are Cybervator isn't it.

- Max (explains): The lag between the CSDs controls small but it's big enough to give Cybervators an advantage over people like us. I got around it by coding the movements direct in real-time

- Yahaira: haha that cyber.beast didn't absorb Torey it killed her consciousness just managed to manifest in the closet beacon it could find 

haha that cyber.beast didn't absorb Torey it killed her taking the bitgems fueled by her emotions along with hit her. 

Have ever wondered why white.type cyber.beast are pretty much unusable by most cybervators.

You see cyber.beast are fueled by emotion darker emotions bread and feed black.type cyber.beast the opposite holds true for white.type cyber.beast. This only possible because unlike everything else in the universe emotions are not bound by space nor time. What you see before you is merely a remanence of her love she had for you, her will to protect you, nothing more.

- Airiona: A Cyber.Beast's abilities are only limited by the imagination of the wilder. It's potential is wasted on people like Jax

- Airiona: Society likes to separate everyone into the smart and the dumb. The smart people like to think they are better than everyone else. But they are no different than everyone else when they succumb to their emotions.

- Someone goes to cut the chain connecting a cybervator to airiona
Kyshumu tells them to stop trying to warn them they will lose their memory the tail is cut off and the cybervator forgets who and where they are

- Minia's/Airiona's sibiling died while getting their cyber.beast this is why Airion'a parents did not allow her to get the procedure

  Jax: but this is the finals
 
  Max: yea the same one we fought an won last year and the year before and basically every year since

  Max looks down in sadness
  
  Max: Listen my dream was to beat Xenos and does that look like Xenos to you. Besides I wanted to do it not to help Kyshumu beat him.
 
  Jax: you think I don't want to be out there too you don't see me complaining. Man up and do your job.
 
  Leona: haha you going on about being a cyber fighter again max I mean at least jax is justfied but you you not even a real cybervator
 
  Max: stay out of this

  Leona: You expect me to be scared of you. Hehe you can't hurt me
 
  Jax: he might not be able to but I can
 
  Leona(walks away with her hands in the air): alright, alright forget I ever said anything
  
- Kyshumu retires during his press conference. Kyshumu announces that he will not be entering the next tournament as he wants to give the the next generation a chance(Jax and Leona)

  Max: May be I should retire too
  
- After the interview Jax confronts Max
  
  Jax: Yea right. You won't quit.
  
  Max: Why not it's just a game
  
  Jax: The CNS is not just some game you can quit when things aren't going your way

- Cut away to the backstory of the CNS and its purpose(much of this info will be reveal t be false later own)

  Airiona is shown watching it
  
  Max and Jax teleports behind Airiona
  
  Max: Hey, whatcha watching?
  
  Airiona(quickly turns off what he was watching): nothing! would it hurt to warn me before teleport out of no were like that
  
  Max: but I thought you said it was cool/awesome when I did that. Wait don't tell me you're too old/cool for this stuff now
  
  Airiona: well I am 12 now
  
  Max: Haha ok well did you watch the CNS finals
  
  Airiona: naw I already knew you'd win.
     
      
  Airiona: Hey is that my food
  
  Jax: I couldn't help my self it was just sitting there
  
  Airiona: But I was eating that
  
  Jax: I'll pay you back
  
  Airiona: that's not the point
  
  Max(smirks): That's Jax for you
  
- Airiona continues viewing the data he found and finds something seemingly shocking
  
  Airiona(Stands up): Huh!? No way!

- Historical the ReNet and BluNet networks has only required that cybervators give 50% of their earnings to fans

- Minia offers her satellite as long as they allow her to compete and let her keep 80% of the gems. Minia is nicknamed Meania for this vary reason. She is thought to be gready as she refuse to share her gems with other cybervators.
  
  They comprimse by requiring cybervators to give 80% of their bitgems many cybervator leave eclipse because of this rule

  After giving 80% of bitgems far more fans contribute to eclipse Max and Aarock is surprised but Minia is pleased after of whiich many more cybervators comeback

When Commentators interview cybervators they buy and use questions submitted by fans
- Max on the verge of being the team MVP is asked by spike what he plans to do after becoming cheif. He says that he didn't become a cyber.fighter because he wants to be cheif if anything I just want to prove that I can win despite the fact that I am not a cybervator. So I guess I will just do whatever the people want
- In last interview before the final match he is asked last time you said that you don't have any plans if you become chief has that changed at all

At the first signs of failure people start to doubt max
- He is not cut out for this
- He is holding his team back

Airiona: Virtue is only for the strong humans like you and I can't win in a world like this on virtue alone. But once we gain that power we can force the world to change.

With Bursun being to powerful Max decides to remove his limiter he try to go into burstdrive instead he goes berserk. He attacks and knocks Bursun out of commision. Airiona gets nervous at first. When Max starts attacking his allies Airiona laughs at the turn of events.

Airiona: Haha I thought you had me there for a second. hehehe. But it looks like you guys have made things far worst for your self

Just when they think they have no way of winning Bursun takes down every cybervator starting with Max who it seemed was going to kill his brother.

Everyone is relieved at first until Bursun turns on them after going off on a monologue. He states that after he finishes with Airiona he will finish what he started--whipping out every envy filled human and placing the cybervators in a cc

Max has gone Berserk Jax takes it upon his self to hold off his brother while the other cyber.fighters attempt to take down the satellite controlling the cybervators which includes

Bursun takes the hostage the cybervators that are left trying to defend Airiona from Bursun

Then show me your resolve show me you have what it takes to be its hero

Minia attempts to aid Max maybe giving him her Cyber.Beast. Bursun stares back at her with intense rage cause Minia to tremble

Max: why isn't she evading

I told you not to interfere

Max sees Airiona fiddling with her CSD

Bursun procedes to kill Minia who froze with fear

Airiona saves Minia sacrificing the Cyber.Beast that was her fathers. At the same time she manges to teleport Minia away to one of the stadium among the fans.

Minia: did Airiona just save me? That never happend to me before I was frozen from fear

Bursun Smiles looking back at Airiona

Max: were you that jealous of your sister that you would stupe so low

Airiona: I... yes. Yes I was

Max screams in rage

Max still yelling appears to be transforming as he glows

Minia: he thinks I'm dead I have to let him know

Airiona(crying): Minia is gone. Everyone is safe. Why are you still trying to save me

Bursun: thats right give into your wrath let Cyber.Beast takeover. In your current state you have no chance of stopping me.

Max(looks back at Airiona):<That's right none of this is her fault it's not Bursun fault either. If it wasn't for me none of this would have happened>

Max desenergizes

Max(looking at Bursun): Niether is my Cyber.Beast state you already made that clear enough.

Max(Smiling looking back at Airiona): Don't worry Airiona I won't change into that beast ever again.

Airiona:  I know you're used to fighting people superior to you in strength but I don't think you fully understand the extent of Bursun’s power/But you shouldn't underestimate Bursun’s power

Max: Don't worry I know good and well what he can do

Max achieves true synergy

Max: <this... agh pain, this is what cybervators experience every time they synergies. No this is probably considered normal for them they've gone through since they were a child and this voice in my head > <kill kill kill>

Max slash through Bursun snatching up Airiona

After Max defeats Bursun he smiles and tells him will done

Afterward Max remembers the Aarock said the same thing win he was was holding back

When Max vists Airiona's class they are all excited that the first Cyber.coordinator is visting the class.

Before the surprise introduction a video is played showing the history of the Cyber.fighter leauge as well as diving into how max is the reason that it is now called the Cyber.Fighter league rather than the cybervator league

With out further a due Max Akinosun

The class is exited to learn that they will get to see Max in person. They shower him with questions

How does it feel to work with cybervators

what do you think about Kyshumu's retirment

Who is you favorite teammate(I beat you he has a crush on leona someone exclaims)

Why did you decide to become a cybervator why are you here

Will you marry me

can I have your autograph

Airiona: are you here for are capstone project

Oh man I picked the worst/wrong day to skip school

Max manages to answer a few of the questions

Max: I guess Jax he is my brother after all

Spike the class cheif tells the class to settle down. He then explains the reason.

As some of you may have guessed by now are capstone project for the year will be focused on improving the cyber.fighter league
