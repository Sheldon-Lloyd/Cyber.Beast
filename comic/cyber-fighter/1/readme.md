## Setup
This is the last year for Max this means that he is eligible lead a portion of this year's project.  The history of the CNS is explained to everyone before they are asked to present their ideas

The world revolves around what is appropriately named the CNS. It is a sports league in which most of every participant is in one-way shape or form. Some professionally, others casually, many more gamble, and for everyone else, it is pure entertainment. Not everyone can rank high enough to compete professionally. Of those few that do even fewer can be what we call Cybervators. They are born with a tail which allows them to synergize with cyber.beast. They are the stars and of course with it come wealth and fame. Being the most powerful among us also comes the responsibility of protecting us. 
Max is sitting in class listening to the lecture and falls asleep
Only red and blue cyber.fighters fight despite the fact that they make up only 25% of the world population
Max has a dream in which he is a cybervator and has to save the world from a huge threat. In his dream he is told that he is the only cybervator that can save the world

You spent years fighting along side and with cybervators as a human now it's time to become the cybervator you were meant to be. save the world Max you're our only hope

## Conflict
Spike is bullied Max is chosen by the teacher Ai to be class leader a role he is somewhat reluctant to take
Spike pulls out a seat to sit at the desk next to Max. As Spike puts his stuff down before sitting down Akia takes Spike's seat.

    Akia: oh look a freshmen

    Akia: gee thanks

    Spike: Hey I was gonna sit there

    Akia: too bad I got here first. Besides what's so special about this seat any ways I don't see your name on it

    Spike(looking at max): I just wanted to--

   Akia: Oh I see you wanted to sit next to him. What do you have a crush on him or something

    Spike: it's nothing like that I just wanted to talk to him

    Akia(grabing Spike): well how about this I'll -tie you two together you'll be like Siamese twins.

    Spike: I wouldn't do that if I was you

    Akia: Why not. Mister tuff guy.

    Spike: He's Max Akinosun the brother of the cybervator Jax Akinosun

    Akia: yea right

    Spike: But it's obvious they share the same last name

    Akia: yea so do plenty of other people. And besides they look nothing alike

Max wakes up from an dream in which he is a cybervator and has to save the world/universe from a large threat

Max is designated as the class leader and is awaken by his classmate Spike

    Ai: As some of you may have guessed by now our capstone project for the year will be focused on improving the cyber.fighter league

    Ai: The first leader for this years capstone project is Max Akinosun. Please introduce yourself and the project proposal for your team

    Spike: hey did you hear

    Max: What...? 

    Spike: your one of the class leaders

    Max: Why me!?


    Max stands up lethargically

    Akia: oh come on, him of all people. Out of everyone, that's who the stupid Ai chooses 

    Max introduces himself to the class explaining his lot in life how he is a human but his brother is a Cybervator despite the chance of it happening being 1%.
    Max is chosen to be class leader ðŸ˜‚

    Max(wipe the sleep from his eye): My name is Max Akinosun. 

    Max(smiling): In case your wonder If I'm related to Jax, the cybervator that I share the same last name with.

    Max: Well long story short as you all know Cybervators only make up 1% of the population and even fewer get a chance to compete in the Cyber.Fighter Championships. You are either lucky enough to be born a cybervator or not

    Max: They're the only ones that can use a cyber.beast to its full potential

    Max: They also own almost half the world's wealth so your pretty lucky if you are born as one

    Akia: get to the point

    Max: Anyways, me I am just an average everyday citizen

    Max: As far as I can remember I have always wanted to be a cyber.fighter

    Max: Although my father was a human my mother was a cybervator. This meant that I had a 99% chance of becoming one as well. Somehow I beat those odds. So instead I live my dreams through my twin brother a cybervator as what he calls a cyber.coordinator. Even though I'm not a cybervator my brother chose me to be his pair. I create the strategies and he executes them. I guess you can say that I'm the brains and he is the brawn

    Akia: ha look at this joker
The class laughs and Max along with them and makes a quip

    Max: ha ha ha funny story I know

    Spike: why are you guys laughing he's telling  the truth

    Akia: what did you say Spike speak up the rest of the class can't hear you

    Spike: I said he's telling the truth!

The class again except Max and Spike bursts out laughing again

    Max: Anyways that's my story I don't really have any ideas but I'm all ears if anyone else has any

    Akia: see told you he'd make a terrible team leader he doesn't even gave a project proposal ready

Spike is the first to express his idea

His plan is to modify the CSD in a way that will allow anyone to compete in the CNS not just Cybervators

Spike plans to be the first human to become a cyber.fighter allowing humans like him and Max to be more than cyber.coordinators but to a be cyber.fighters.

Max tells him that he is not old enough to be a cyber.fighter. The entire class laughs making fun of him

    :I bet he is just trying to impress him because he thinks he is Jax's brother.

    Akia: you don't even have a tail slapping him in the back of the head

    Spike(Embarrassed): I know that I'm not a cybervator that she know that she is not old enough. It is just--

Spike expression changes from anger to embarrassment

Seeing that things have been made worse Max has a look of remorse

    Max: interjects You guys didn't let me finish. You can't be the first human cyber.fighter. I'll be the first human cyber.fighter. And since cybervator with red hair are called red.types and cybervators with blue hair are called blue.types we'll call our selves green.types

Spike raises his eyebrows maybe smiling

The class chatters/whispers Is he serious.

    Max: any other ideas

the class remains silent

Jax appears and the class's attention then turns towards Jax. 

Jax comes to pick Max up for their match exclaim they will be late

    Jax: let's go baby brother we're gonna be late for our first match

    Spike: told you

The class sitting behind him falls silent or chatters amongst themselves. 

    Max(whispers): I can't leave in the middle of class

    Max(looks at his watch): and besides it's only 17 o'clock, the match doesn't start for another 2 hours

    Jax: oh 

    Jax: man I can't wait that long

    Spike: then stay here

    Jax: What/huh? I came here to fight I didn't come to play school. Classes are pointless

    : isn't he Tomasina's son? 

    : his brother really is Jax! Maybe he's already a cybervator too.

    : No dummy if he was a cybervator he'd be able to download whatever information he needed. He wouldn't need to go to school

The class is excited to learn that their classmate Max is the brother of Jax. They shower him and Max with questions

    How does it feel to work with cybervators

    Hey Jax what do you think about Tomasina's retirement rumors

    Who is you favorite cybervator

    I bet you he has a crush on Leona someone exclaims

    Max: I guess Tomasina, she is my mother after all

    Why did you decide to become a cybervator why are you here

    Will you marry me

    can I have your autograph

    Spike: are you here for are capstone project

    : Oh man I picked the worst/wrong day to skip school

    Jax stands there smiling and Max manages to answer a few of the questions

    Jax(Smirking): I guess I'll stay for a while

Akia the class chief tells the class to settle down. She then explains her idea.

    Akia: Would you guys shur up already

Afterward everyone wants to join Max's team giving their ideas including Akia but Max chooses Spike.

The class presents ideas for the CNS
- someone plans to instead of one commentator he wants to have 2 making it more engaging for the audience and maybe also read comments from their live stream favoring those that pay and with high up votes.
- one person wants to bring broadcasting into cyberspace in this case most of the class joins him
- Akia names her project Spike tv as a joke to antagonize Spike

## Resolution

Max and Jax prepares to fight Aarock and Max discusses his dream
Jax teleports Max to their hub

    Tomasina: You boys ready for your match

    Jax: I was born ready for this mom

    Tomasina: ha ha of course you were, you're a cybervator. What about you you Max.

    Max: yea sure

    Tomasina/Jax(nudging Max): whats wrong your not getting nervous are you


They have a seat. Max sets his unfinished drink down.

    Max: It's not that it's just I had this weird dream while I was in class

Max talks how it was bitter sweet just as Jax takes some of Max's food to lighten the mood as he has seen that Max's mood has become somber. 

    Max: it was kind of bitter sweet

    Max: hey that's mine 
    
    Jax: you tricked me. It's not bitter or sweet
    
    Max: I was talking about my dream not my meal

    Tomasina: Hey Max.
