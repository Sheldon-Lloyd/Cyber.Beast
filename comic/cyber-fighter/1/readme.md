# Episode 1 Outline
## Act 1
Max is seen sleeping dreaming about his past wanting to be a Cyber.Fighter 5 years ago

He is sleep during class on the train or is late for class

The project for the year is sponsored by the CNS the class is given the task to improve it.

This is the last year for Max this means that he must lead a portion of this years project.  The history of the CNS is explained to everyone before they are asked to present their ideas

Spike explains how he will change the presentation of the CNS
- He plans to instead of one commentator he wants to have 2 making it more engaging for the audience and maybe also read comments from their live stream favoring those that pay and with high up votes. He chooses Akia as his partner 
- or he wants to bring broadcasting into cyberspace in this case most of the class jions him

Max presents his idea and is laughed at by everyone
- His plan is to modify the CSD in a way that will allow anyone to compete in the CNS not just Cybervators
- he is told by Akia that he does not even have a tail
- Airiona is the only person the class that appears intrigued

Max gets back home and checks if anyone has signed up to join his project
- Max of course no one would want to help with my project. Heck if it wasn't for that fact that the CNS is not even run by a human my proposal probably would have never been accepted.

Airiona stops by Max's house to watch round 2 of the Cyber.Fighter Championships

Airiona tells Max that she will help with his project 
- Airiona: I'll help with your project. (Max look somewhat happy about this raising both eye brows) under one condition...
 - Max raises one of his eyebrows
 - Airiona: if you watch the cyber.fighter championships with me
 -Max: Ha haha sure

Jax takes Airiona's food that she brought or that  Max gave to her
## Act 2

## Act 3






Jax is called up to replace him

## Act 1: Max explains his lot in life as he coordinates Kyshumu Leona and/or Jax

TV: you are watching a presentation of the CNS

[Cybvators only make up 1% of the population and even fewer get a chance to compete in the Cyber.Fighter Championships. You are either lucky enough to be born a cybervator or not]

[They are the only ones that can use a cyber.beast to its full potential ]

[They also own almost half the world's wealth so your pretty lucky if you are born as one]

[Me I am just an average everyday citizen]

[As far as I can remember I have always wanted to be a cyber.fighter]

[My father was a human my mother was a cybervator. This meant that I had a 99% chance of becoming one as well. Some how I beat those odds. So instead I live my dreams through my twin brother a cybervator]

Max is shown equiping Kyshumu's dangling hands with gaulents. He is sitting low enough so that Max can reach but high enough so that Max  must look and even reach up in order to equip him.
(this is meant to show the difference in status between the two)

Max tells Kyshumu what he has equiped him with along with the reasoning behind his strategy based on his opponent

Max: I'm equiping you with the leopard gautlents. Avis uses a [birds name] cyber.beast and likes to spend most of his time in the air waiting for the right chance to attack.

Kyshumu stands and says nothing but the words(Got it) can be seen in the Visor of Max of what Kyshumu said.
(It is detail ment to only be seen by a keen eye others may assumme that Kyshumu is arogant)

Avis takes flight but Kyshumu leaps taking Avis down with ease

Jax and Leona is shown sitting cross legged on a pedstal

Jax exclaims that this match will be a piece of cake(has it in a bag) based on the years championships in which he himself was a part of which was Aarock and Alex. Max warns that he shouldn't be so sure and should not underestimate Aarock. Leona is shown peeking at the conversation opening one of her eyes

  Did you not see what just happened there's no way they are winning

To shock of Kyshumu and everyone else Aarock fights toe-to-toe with Kyshumu.

## Act 2: Leona Fights Aarock

Aarock or the commentators explain how Aarock had gotten so strong gaining the nick name eater

Aarock starts to question Kyshumu's leadership

Ace/Aarock asks Kyshumu what he has to lose that Kyshumu has pretty much loss/won the round. He then ask if he is scared that his daughter would lose. He says what is the point of having a partner if he does all of the fighting.

He tells Kyshumu that he has held his entire Network back doing every thing for them.

Leona Demands that she is allowed to defend her pride.

Kyshumu says lets test that theory. He sends Leona to battle in his place. Aarock also switches out with Ace

## Act 3: Leona is on the brink of losing

Despite Leona's advantage she has when it comes to her power handed down from Kyshumu it is far from enough to overcome the far greater gap in skill her opponent has over her.

Jax: That your daughter aren't you going to help her.

Kyshumu stands there with his arms crossed

Max/Jax: she getting destroyed out there. Arent you going to do something
